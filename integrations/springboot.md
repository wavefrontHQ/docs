This page provides an overview of what you can do with the Spring Boot integration. The documentation pages only for a limited number of integrations contain the setup steps and instructions. If you do not see the setup steps here, navigate to the Operations for Applications GUI. The detailed instructions for setting up and configuring all integrations, including the Spring Boot integration are on the **Setup** tab of the integration.

1. Log in to your Operations for Applications instance. 
2. Click **Integrations** on the toolbar, search for and click the **Spring Boot** tile. 
3. Click the **Setup** tab and you will see the most recent and up-to-date instructions.

## Spring Boot Integration

Spring Boot lets you set up, configure, and run both simple and web-based applications. Operations for Applications supports Spring Boot in two ways:

- This integration has setup steps for configuring a Spring Boot application to send data to Operations for Applications. A dashboard for examining metrics is included with this integration.
- The [Spring Boot tutorial](https://docs.wavefront.com/wavefront_springboot3_tutorial.html) shows how to send data using the Spring Petclinic application.

In addition to setting up the metrics flow, this integration also installs a dashboard that allows you to monitor the performance of your Spring Boot application. Here's a preview of the dashboard:
