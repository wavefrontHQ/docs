# Uptime Integration

Uptime provides website downtime alerts by SMS, phone call and/or email if your website is down. Uptime checks your website availability at 1-minute intervals from 30 different locations across 6 continents.
 
This integration explains how to configure Uptime to push response time metrics and alerts to Operations for Applications. After you've completed the integration setup, you can view response time metrics and alerts for the websites that are being monitored by Uptime in Operations for Applications. In addition to setting up the metrics flow, this integration also installs a dashboard.
Here's the screenshot of Uptime dashboard displaying response time metrics:
