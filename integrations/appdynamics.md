## AppDynamics Integration

The AppDynamics integration is a native integration that offers agentless ingestion of metrics from a AppDynamics SaaS service.

### Metrics Configuration
This integration can be configured to pull all application metrics from AppDynamics. If you want to pull only certain application metrics, configure filters while setting up the integration.

Metrics that originate from AppDynamics are prefixed with `appdynamics.apps.` in [[applicationName]]. After you set up the integration, you can browse the available metrics in the metrics browser.


## AppDynamics Setup

Follow the steps given below to give [[applicationName]] access to AppDynamics account:

1. Log in to your [[applicationName]] instance.
1. From the taskbar, click **Integrations** and search for **AppDynamics**.
1. Click the **AppDynamics** tile.
1. Click the **Setup** tab and click **Add Integration**.
1. Fill in the details and click **Register**.

Now, you see the metrics from your AppDynamics account in [[applicationName]].
