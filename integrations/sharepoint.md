## SharePoint Integration

SharePoint is a web-based, collaborative platform that integrates with Microsoft Office.
This integration installs and configures Telegraf to send SharePoint metrics into Wavefront. Telegraf is a light-weight server process capable of collecting, processing, aggregating, and sending metrics to a [Wavefront proxy](https://docs.wavefront.com/proxies.html).

In addition to setting up the metrics flow, this integration also installs a dashboard. Here's the WWW(Web) Services section of a dashboard displaying SharePoint metrics:
