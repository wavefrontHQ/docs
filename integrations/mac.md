## Mac Host Integration

Monitoring Mac hosts is easy with Wavefront. This integration installs and configures Telegraf to send host metrics
into Wavefront. Telegraf is a light-weight server process capable of collecting, processing, aggregating, and sending metrics to a [Wavefront proxy](https://docs.wavefront.com/proxies.html).

In addition to setting up the metrics flow, this integration also installs a dashboard. For example, here's the CPU section of a dashboard displaying Mac host metrics.
