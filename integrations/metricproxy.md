## Metricproxy Integration

Metricproxy is an open source project from SignalFx that can aggregate metrics from multiple sources like Graphite (carbon), collectd, or SignalFx, and send them to servers using the carbon, collectd or SignalFx protocols. This integration describes how to configure Metricproxy to accept the time series data and send them to a [Wavefront proxy](https://docs.wavefront.com/proxies.html).
