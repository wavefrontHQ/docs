## Splunk On-Call Integration

Splunk On-Call is a popular incident lifecycle management platform.
You can use Operations for Applications alerts to trigger a Splunk On-Call incident of varying types (information, warning, critical) and also to let Splunk On-Call know when an alert has stopped firing to mark the incident as recovered within the Splunk On-Call timeline. With the help of webhooks you can integrate Operations for Applications alerts with Splunk On-Call.
