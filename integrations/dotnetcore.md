## .NET Core Integration

The .NET Core is a general-purpose, most versatile framework that may be used to build software applications for Windows, Linux, and MacOS.
This integration installs and configures the Wavefront Collector for Kubernetes to collect the .NET Core performance metrics and uses the [Wavefront proxy](https://docs.wavefront.com/proxies.html) for sending those metrics to VMware Aria Operations for Applications.

Here's a preview of the .NET Core on Kubernetes dashboard:
