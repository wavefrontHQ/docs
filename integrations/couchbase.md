## Couchbase Integration

Couchbase Server is an open-source, distributed  multi-model NoSQL database. This integration installs and configures Telegraf to send Couchbase metrics into Tanzu Observability. Telegraf is a light-weight server process capable of collecting, processing, aggregating, and sending metrics to a [Wavefront proxy](https://docs.wavefront.com/proxies.html).

In addition to setting up the metrics flow, this integration also installs a dashboard.
