This page provides an overview of what you can do with the Webhooks integration. The documentation pages only for a limited number of integrations contain the setup steps and instructions. If you do not see the setup steps here, navigate to the Operations for Applications GUI. The detailed instructions for setting up and configuring all integrations, including the Webhooks integration are on the **Setup** tab of the integration.

1. Log in to your Operations for Applications instance. 
2. Click **Integrations** on the toolbar, search for and click the **Webhooks** tile. 
3. Click the **Setup** tab and you will see the most recent and up-to-date instructions.

## Webhooks

Webhooks allow your application to send out information using HTTP callbacks. Operations for Applications supports webhooks through the Webhook alert target. You can use an alert target to send notifications that are based on alert trigger conditions.
