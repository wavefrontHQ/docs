## OpenTelemetry Integration

OpenTracing and OpenCensus merged to form OpenTelemetry. OpenTelemetry provides a single set of APIs, libraries, agents, and collector services to capture distributed traces and metrics from your application.




If your application uses OpenTelemetry, you can configure the application to send traces and metrics to Tanzu Observability by Wavefront.
For detailed instructions, see [Send OpenTelemetry data to Tanzu Observability](https://docs.wavefront.com/opentelemetry_tracing.html).
