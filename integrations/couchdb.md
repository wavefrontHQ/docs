## CouchDB Integration

Apache CouchDB is an open source document-oriented NoSQL database. This integration installs and configures Telegraf to send CouchDB metrics into Wavefront. Telegraf is a light-weight server process capable of collecting, processing, aggregating, and sending metrics to a [Wavefront proxy](https://docs.wavefront.com/proxies.html).

In addition to setting up the metrics flow, this integration also installs a dashboard. Here's the Performance Counters section of a dashboard displaying CouchDB metrics:
