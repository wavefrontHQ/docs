## VMware Tanzu™ Kubernetes Grid™ Integration

VMware Tanzu™ Kubernetes Grid™ Integrated Edition, previously called VMware PKS, enables operators to provision, operate, and manage enterprise-grade Kubernetes clusters. This integration uses the [wavefront-kubernetes-collector](https://github.com/wavefrontHQ/wavefront-kubernetes-collector), which runs natively in Kubernetes. The integration collects detailed metrics about the containers, namespaces, nodes, pods, deployments, services and the cluster itself. See [VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integration Details](https://docs.wavefront.com/integrations_tkgi.html) for a list of predefined alerts, an architecture overview, and troubleshooting info.

This integration explains how to configure Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition monitoring with Wavefront from the PKS tile present in PCF Ops Manager. After you've completed the integration setup, you can use Wavefront to monitor the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition cluster.

In addition to setting up the metrics flow, this integration also installs a dashboard. Here's a preview of the **Summary** dashboard.

## VMware Tanzu™ Kubernetes Grid™ Integrated Edition Setup

  Supported Version: VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition 1.9 and later. See the [Documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Pivotal-Container-Service/index.html) for details.

  **Note:**
  * For VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition 1.4 through 1.8, see VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition (Archived).
  * VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition was previously called VMware PKS. For setup instructions for VMware PKS 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 versions, log in to the Wavefront instance and see VMware PKS (Archived).

### Configuring the Wavefront Account

1. Log in to PCF Ops Manager and click the **Pivotal Container Service** tile in Installation Dashboard.
2. Under the **Settings** tab, click **Monitoring**.
3. In the right pane, check **Yes** to enable **Wavefront Integration** and enter the account information:
   * **Wavefront URL**: `https://YOUR_CLUSTER.wavefront.com/api`
   * **API Token**: `YOUR_API_TOKEN`
     * **NOTE:** See [Generating an API Token](https://docs.wavefront.com/wavefront_api.html#generating-an-api-token).
   * **Wavefront Alert Recipient**: `A list of Email addresses and/or Wavefront Target IDs`
     * **NOTE:** This field is required only for version 1.9.0 or earlier.
