## Kong Integration

Kong is an open-source Microservice API gateway.
This integration installs and configures Telegraf to send Kong metrics into Tanzu Observability. Telegraf is a light-weight server process capable of collecting, processing, aggregating, and sending metrics to a [Wavefront proxy](https://docs.wavefront.com/proxies.html).

In addition to setting up the metrics flow, this integration also installs a dashboard. Here's the Summary section of the dashboard.
