## Wavefront Ansible Role Integration

Ansible is an open-source automation engine that automates software provisioning, configuration management, and application deployment. The Wavefront Ansible role installs and configures the Wavefront proxy (`wavefront-proxy`) or collector (`telegraf`) agent, which allows you to automate Wavefront proxy and Telegraf collector agent installation on multiple hosts.
