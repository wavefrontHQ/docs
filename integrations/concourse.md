## Concourse CI Integration

Concourse is an automation system that is most commonly used for CI/CD. It allows users to build and monitor the pipeline and it takes only one click to get from a failed job to see why it failed.

In addition to setting up the metrics flow, this integration also installs a dashboard that allows you to monitor the Concourse CI. Here's a preview of the dashboard:
