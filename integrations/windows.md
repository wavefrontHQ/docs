## Windows Host Integration

Monitoring Windows hosts is easy with Operations for Applications. This integration installs and configures Telegraf to send host metrics
into Operations for Applications. Telegraf is a light-weight server process capable of collecting, processing, aggregating, and sending metrics to a [Wavefront proxy](https://docs.wavefront.com/proxies.html).

In addition to setting up the metrics flow, this integration also installs a dashboard. Here's the CPU section of a dashboard displaying Windows host metrics.
