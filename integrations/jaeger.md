3. Click the **Setup** tab and you will see the most recent and up-to-date instructions.

## Jaeger Integration

Jaeger is a popular open-source distributed tracing system. The [Wavefront proxy](https://docs.wavefront.com/proxies.html) supports the Jaeger Thrift trace data format.

Click the **Setup** tab for instructions on:

* Enabling the Wavefront proxy to support the Jaeger Thrift data format.
* Understanding configuration requirements for Jaeger clients and agents that send trace data to the Wavefront proxy.

The [documentation](https://docs.wavefront.com/tracing_integrations.html) explains integration requirements, how to specify custom tags for RED metrics, custom application names and more.
