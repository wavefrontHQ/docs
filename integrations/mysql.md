## MySQL Integration

MySQL is an open source relational database management system. This integration installs and configures Telegraf to send MySQL metrics into Operations for Applications. Telegraf is a light-weight server process capable of collecting, processing, aggregating, and sending metrics to a [Wavefront proxy](https://docs.wavefront.com/proxies.html).

In addition to setting up the metrics flow, this integration also installs a dashboard. For example, here's screenshot of dashboard with statistics collected from MySQL server.
