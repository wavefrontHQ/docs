## FoundationDB Integration

FoundationDB is a distributed database designed to handle large volumes of structured data across clusters of commodity servers. This integration installs and configures Telegraf to send FoundationDB metrics into Tanzu Observability. Telegraf is a light-weight server process capable of collecting, processing, aggregating, and sending metrics to a [Wavefront proxy](https://docs.wavefront.com/proxies.html).

In addition to setting up the metrics flow, this integration also installs a dashboard. Here are sections of a dashboard displaying FoundationDB metrics:
