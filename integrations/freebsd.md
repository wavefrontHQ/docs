## FreeBSD Host Integration

FreeBSD is a free and open-source Unix-like operating system. Monitoring FreeBSD hosts is easy with Wavefront. This integration steps you through installing and configuring the Wavefront proxy and the Telegraf. Telegraf is a light-weight server process capable of collecting, processing, aggregating, and sending metrics to a [Wavefront proxy](https://docs.wavefront.com/proxies.html).

In addition to setting up the metrics flow, this integration also installs a dashboard. Here are the **Summary** and **CPU** sections of a dashboard displaying FreeBSD host metrics.
