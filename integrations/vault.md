## Hashicorp Vault Integration

Hashicorp Vault provides a unified interface for securely storing and accessing secrets such as API keys, passwords, or certificates

This integration installs and configures Telegraf to send Hashicorp Vault metrics into Tanzu Observability. Telegraf is a light-weight server process capable of collecting, processing, aggregating, and sending metrics to a [Wavefront proxy](https://docs.wavefront.com/proxies.html).

In addition to setting up the metrics flow, this integration also installs a dashboard. Here's a preview of some charts in the Hashicorp Vault dashboard.
