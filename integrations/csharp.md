# C Sharp Integration

This integration explains how to send C# application metrics to Tanzu Observability.

Applications written in C# can send metrics, delta counters, histogram distributions, spans, and events directly to Tanzu Observability or to a Wavefront proxy.

This is a custom integration. You can send your own metrics and create your own dashboards.
