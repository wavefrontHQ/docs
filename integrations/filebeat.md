## Filebeat Integration

The Filebeat integration is a metricized logs solution, which lets you extract metrics from Filebeat logs. Once your Filebeat log data arrives at the proxy, the proxy converts it to metrics by parsing log lines with grok patterns (regular expressions) that you specify in the proxy configuration file. When log metrics start flowing, you can create queries to visualize the data and create alerts.
