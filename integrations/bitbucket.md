## Atlassian Bitbucket

Atlassian Bitbucket is a repository hosting service for source code and development projects that use Git.

This integration installs and configures Telegraf to send Atlassian Bitbucket metrics into Wavefront. Telegraf is a light-weight server process capable of collecting, processing, aggregating, and sending metrics to a [Wavefront proxy](https://docs.wavefront.com/proxies.html).

In addition to setting up the metrics flow, this integration also installs a dashboard. Here's a preview of some charts in the Atlassian Bitbucket dashboard.
