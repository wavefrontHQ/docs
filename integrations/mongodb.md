2. Click **Integrations** on the toolbar, search for and click the **MongoDB** tile. 
3. Click the **Setup** tab and you will see the most recent and up-to-date instructions.

## mongoDB Integration

mongoDB is an open source NoSQL, cross-platform document-oriented database. This integration installs and configures Telegraf to send mongoDB metrics into Tanzu Observability. Telegraf is a light-weight server process capable of collecting, processing, aggregating, and sending metrics to a [Wavefront proxy](https://docs.wavefront.com/proxies.html).

In addition to setting up the metrics flow, this integration also installs a dashboard. Here's a screen shot of an example dashboard with statistics collected from mongoDB.
