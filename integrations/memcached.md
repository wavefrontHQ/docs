## Memcached Integration

Memcached is a popular distributed memory caching system. This integration installs and configures Telegraf to send Memcached metrics into Wavefront. Telegraf is a light-weight server process capable of collecting, processing, aggregating, and sending metrics to a [Wavefront proxy](https://docs.wavefront.com/proxies.html).

In addition to setting up the metrics flow, this integration also installs a dashboard for monitoring an Memcached cluster.  Here's a screenshot of that dashboard:
