1. Log in to your Operations for Applications instance. 
2. Click **Integrations** on the toolbar, search for and click the **nodejs** tile. 
3. Click the **Setup** tab and you will see the most recent and up-to-date instructions.

## Node.js Integration

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. The Node.js package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

This Node.js integration provides Wavefront reporters for the Node.js [metrics](https://github.com/mikejihbe/metrics) library. The reporters support sending metrics to Wavefront using the [Wavefront proxy](https://docs.wavefront.com/proxies.html) or using [direct ingestion](https://docs.wavefront.com/direct_ingestion.html). You can assign point tags at both the reporter and metric levels.

This is a custom integration. You can send your own metrics and create your own dashboards.
