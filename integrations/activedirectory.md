## Active Directory Integration

Active Directory (AD) is a Windows OS directory service. This integration installs and configures Telegraf to send Active Directory metrics into Wavefront. Telegraf is a light-weight server process capable of collecting, processing, aggregating, and sending metrics to a [Wavefront proxy](https://docs.wavefront.com/proxies.html).

In addition to setting up the metrics flow, this integration also installs a dashboard. Here's a section of a dashboard displaying Active Directory metrics:
