## Consul Integration

 Hashicorp Consul allows you to discover and configure services in your environment. This integration provides a real-time status for both **Cloud Managed** and **Open source (Self-managed) Consul** nodes.
This integration installs and configures Telegraf to send Consul server metrics into Wavefront. Telegraf is a light-weight server process capable of collecting, processing, aggregating, and sending metrics to a [Wavefront proxy](https://docs.wavefront.com/proxies.html).

In addition to setting up the metrics flow, this integration also installs a dashboard. Here's a preview of some charts in the Consul dashboard.

To see a list of the metrics for this integration, select the integration from <https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs>.
## Consul Setup
This integration collects metrics from both **Cloud Managed** and **Open source (Self-managed) Consul** nodes.



### Step 1. Install the Telegraf Agent

This integration uses the Consul input plugin for Telegraf to extract metrics from Consul.

Log in to your Operations for Applications instance, navigate to the integration, and follow the instructions on the **Setup** tab to install Telegraf and the Wavefront proxy in your environment. If a proxy is already running in your environment, you can select that proxy and the Telegraf install command connects with that proxy.

### Step 2. Enable the Consul input plugin

Create a file called `consul.conf` in `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.d` and enter the following snippet:
{% raw %}
```
# # Gather health check statuses from services registered in Consul
[[inputs.consul]]
  ## Most of these values default to the value configured at the Consul agent level.
  ## Optional Consul server address (default: "localhost")
  # address = "localhost"
  ## Optional URI scheme for the Consul server (default: "http")
  # scheme = "http"
  ## Metric version controls the mapping from Consul metrics into
  ## Telegraf metrics. Version 2 moved all fields with string values
  ## to tags.
  ##
  ##   example: metric_version = 1; deprecated in 1.16
  ##            metric_version = 2; recommended version
  metric_version = 2
  ## Optional ACL token used in every request (default: "")
  # token = ""
  ## Optional username used for request HTTP Basic Authentication (default: "")
  # username = ""
  ## Optional password used for HTTP Basic Authentication (default: "")
  # password = ""
  ## Optional data center to query (default: "")
  # datacentre = ""
```
{% endraw %}
### Step 3. Restart Telegraf

Run `sudo service telegraf restart` to restart your Telegraf agent.
