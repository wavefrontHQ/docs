## Microsoft Hyper-V Integration

Microsoft Hyper-V is a server virtualization platform that provides virtualization services through hypervisor-based emulations.

This integration installs and configures Telegraf to send Hyper-V metrics into Wavefront. Telegraf is a light-weight server process capable of collecting, processing, aggregating, and sending metrics to a [Wavefront proxy](https://docs.wavefront.com/proxies.html).

In addition to setting up the metrics flow, this integration also installs a dashboard. Here's a preview of some charts in the Hyper-V dashboard.
