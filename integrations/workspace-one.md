## VMware Workspace ONE Access

VMware Workspace ONE Access delivers multifactor authentication (MFA), conditional access and single sign-on (SSO). By acting as a broker to other identity stores and providers, Workspace ONE Access enables organizations to deliver secure and consistent enterprise-wide access to applications and data.

After you've completed the Wavefront integration for Workspace ONE Access setup, all users in your enterprise that can authenticate to Workspace ONE Access can also log in to your Wavefront instance. What those users can do depends on their permission. All users are in the Everyone group and have, at a minimum, view permissions for dashboards and alerts. Additional permissions depend on the Permissions setup in your Wavefront instance. See [Roles, Groups, and Permissions](https://docs.wavefront.com/users_roles.html).
