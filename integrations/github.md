## Github Integration
GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git and adds access control and collaboration features.

This integration installs and configures Telegraf to send Github metrics into Tanzu Observability. Telegraf is a light-weight server process capable of collecting, processing, aggregating, and sending metrics to a [Wavefront proxy](https://docs.wavefront.com/proxies.html).

In addition to setting up the metrics flow, this integration installs a dashboard. Here are the **Overview** and **Events** sections of a dashboard displaying Github metrics:
