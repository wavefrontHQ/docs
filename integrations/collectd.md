## collectd Integration

[collectd](https://collectd.org/) is a daemon that periodically collects system and application performance metrics. This integration describes how to send collected data to Wavefront using the Graphite plugin.

For step-by-step instructions for using collectd as the collector agent with Apache, Cassandra, Memcached, MySQL, NGiNX, Redis, and Zookeeper, see [our documentation pages](https://docs.wavefront.com/integrations_collectd.html).
