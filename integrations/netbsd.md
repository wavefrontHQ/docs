The detailed instructions for setting up and configuring all integrations, including the NetBSD Host integration are on the **Setup** tab of the integration.

1. Log in to your Operations for Applications instance. 
2. Click **Integrations** on the toolbar, search for and click the **NetBSD Host** tile. 
3. Click the **Setup** tab and you will see the most recent and up-to-date instructions.

## NetBSD Host Integration

NetBSD is a free and open-source Unix-like operating system. Monitoring NetBSD hosts is easy with Wavefront. This integration steps you through installing and configuring the Wavefront proxy and Collectd. Collectd is a Unix daemon capable of collecting, processing, aggregating, and sending metrics to a [Wavefront proxy](https://docs.wavefront.com/proxies.html) in Graphite data format.

In addition to setting up the metrics flow, this integration also installs a dashboard. Here are the **Summary** and **CPU** sections of a dashboard displaying NetBSD host metrics.
