## Lighttpd Integration

Lighttpd is a fast, secure, and flexible web server that has been optimized for high-performance environments.

This integration installs and configures Telegraf to send Lighttpd server metrics into Wavefront. Telegraf is a light-weight server process capable of collecting, processing, aggregating, and sending metrics to a [Wavefront proxy](https://docs.wavefront.com/proxies.html).

In addition to setting up the metrics flow, this integration also installs a dashboard. Here's a preview of some charts in the Lighttpd dashboard.
