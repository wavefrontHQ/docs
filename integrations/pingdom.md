## Pingdom Integration

Pingdom lets you monitor the uptime and performance of your website and server. This integration installs and configures Telegraf to send Pingdom metrics into Tanzu Observability. Telegraf is a light-weight server process capable of collecting, processing, aggregating, and sending metrics to a [Wavefront proxy](https://docs.wavefront.com/proxies.html).

In addition to setting up the metrics flow, this integration also installs a dashboard. Here are sections of a dashboard displaying Pingdom metrics:
