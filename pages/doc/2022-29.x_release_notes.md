These release notes give an overview of the changes for the 2022-22.x to 2022-29.x releases of the VMware Aria Operations for Applications (previously known as Tanzu Observability by Wavefront) service.


## 2022-29.x Release Notes

* **Tracing Improvements**: If your application or service names have special characters, the Wavefront service now replaces each special character with a hyphen ("-"). A character that isn't in the following list is considered a special character: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, hyphen ("-"), underscore ("_"), dot ("."), forward slash ("/") and comma (",").

* **Accessibility and Keyboard Navigation Improvements**: We made keyboard navigation improvements to the **Create Alert** page and the **Maintenance Window** page.

* **Query Stats and Suggestions for Alerts**: You can now examine statistics and explore suggestions for alert queries by clicking on the lightbulb icon. See [Use Statistics and Suggestions](query_language_performance.html#use-statistics-and-suggestions).

You can also select to display a link to the [Troubleshooting Missing Data](missing_data_troubleshooting.html) documentation page. For details, see [Override the No Data Message on a Chart](ui_charts.html#override-the-no-data-message-on-a-chart).
