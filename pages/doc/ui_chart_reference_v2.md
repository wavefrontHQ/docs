## Data Tab (All Charts)

For each chart (with the exception of a Markdown chart) you specify one or more queries.

When you select **Data**, you can:
* View queries for the chart and add lines.
* Use [Chart Builder](chart_builder.html) or [Query Editor](query_editor.html).
* Clone, delete, or hide one or more lines.
* Create an alert based on a chart.
* Bring up AI Genie for anomaly detection and forecasting.

## Line Plot Chart

![line plot](images/line_plot_v2.png)

Line plots are well suited both for single time series and multiple time series. You can customize many aspects of your line plots.

A **line plot** represents interpolated point buckets. The X axis represents the amount of time in your time window and the Y axis represents the value associated with the data based on that time.

Missing data is represented by a dashed line. The dashed line only gives a visual representation of the data stream; it _does not_ represent values of the missing data. If you hover over the chart, you won't see values where the gap threshold has been applied. Use the **Format > Gap Threshold** property to set the amount of time before gaps of missing data display as dashed lines.

### Format Tab

<tr>
<td>Summarization</td>
<td>Summarization method for grouping raw, reported data points, and for mapping them to displayable values. When displaying metrics, Wavefront determines the chart resolution and establishes an appropriate time interval as the chart's bucket size.  We then aggregate (combine) the raw data values that are reported within each such time interval, to produce a single value to display for each bucket. The chosen summarization method determines how the aggregation is performed.

<ul>
<li><strong>Average</strong> - Display the average (mean) of the raw data values in each bucket.</li>
<li><strong>Median</strong> - Display the median of the raw data values in each bucket.</li>

### Axis Tab

The Axis tab lets you customize the Y axis. The customizaiton is the same for both Line Plot and Point Plot. See [Use a Logarithmic Y Axis for Skewed Data](ui_charts_v2.html#use-a-logarithmic-y-axis-for-skewed-data) and  [Use ICE/Binary Prefixes in Y Axes and Legends](ui_charts_v2.html#use-icebinary-prefixes-in-y-axis-and-legends) for instructions.

<td>Scale of the Y-axis: linear or logarithmic. Default is linear. In most cases, linear is sufficient as long as there is not a large difference in measurement between the reported data points. If there's a large difference in measurement scale, use the logarithmic scale. By default, the logarithmic scale is set to the power of 10. You can configure the scale in the adjacent text field.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Min/Max</td>
<td>Minimum and maximum value on the Y-axis. If you are using a double Y-axis, you can specify min/max values for each Y-axis (By default, set to auto).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Unit</td>
<td>Unit of measurement to assign to the label that appears along the Y-axis. This unit <em>does not</em> change the unit of measurement. If you are using a double Y-axis, you can specify a unit for each Y-axis.
<p>Supported units are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time - Ranges from yoctoseconds (ys) to years (yr)</li>
<li>IEC/Binary - data size in IEC/Binary units. Ranges from B (bytes) to YiB</li>
<li>SI - data rate in SI units. Ranges from bps (bits/s) to Ybps</li>

### Legend Tab

Controls the legend displayed for the chart by default. The options are the same for line plot and point plot charts.

When you look at the chart, you can also control the legend with these keyboard shortcuts:
* **Shift-P** -- Pin the legend.
* **Shift** -- Show detailed units in the legend.

## Point Plot Chart

![point plot](images/point_plot_v2.png)

A **point plot** chart displays point buckets *without* any interpolation. Like a line chart, the X-axis represents the amount of time in your time window, and the Y-axis represents the value associated with the data during that time window.

## Stacked Area Chart

![stacked area](images/stacked_area_v2.png)

A **stacked area** chart is a line chart but each line is filled in as a solid block with blocks stacked top of each other. With the default Stack Type of zero, the peak of the chart at any time is the sum of the magnitudes of all  sources at that time.

The stacked area chart can help you determine at a glance which queries have the largest magnitude at any point in time. It is most commonly used to visually compare two or more quantities.

## Table Chart

![table chart](images/table_chart_v2.png)

A table chart doesn't support changes to the legend but allows fine-grained customization in the Format tab.

<table>
<tbody>
<thead>
<tr><th width="20%">Option</th><th width="80%">Description</th></tr>
</thead>
<tr>
<td>Summarization</td>
<td>Each line in a table is a summary of all of available data points, as set in the Summarized By field, based on the configured time window.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Point Tag Columns to Display</td>
<td>Allows you to show all point tags, only a selected number, or only metrics with a certain tag key.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Show Sources</td>
<td>Select to display the sources in the table.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Show Labels</td>
<td>Select to display labels in the table. A label is the metric name associated with the data or the query expression resulting from an aggregation. TBD details
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Show Raw Values</td>
<td>Check to display the raw metric values (e.g. 212.00 milliseconds) or values using scientific notation (SI), e.g. 212 milliseconds.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Group by Sources</td>
<td>Whether to group the column results by source.  If you select <strong>Group by Source</strong>, the table lists the grouped sources in the first column and the values for each metric in separate columns.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sort Values Descending</td>
<td>Check to sort values descending (largest to smallest) or ascending (smallest to largest).
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Axis Tab

The Axis tab of a table chart allows you to limit which values show up in the chart. Consider this example table, which users have to scroll:

![table chart no min](images/table_chart_no_min.png)

You can specify a minimum of 200 milliseconds to show only values of interest:

![table chart no min](images/table_chart_with_min.png)


<table>
<tbody>
<thead>
<tr><th width="15%">Option</th><th width="85%">Description</th></tr>
</thead>
<tr>
<td>Min/Max</td>
<td>The minimum and maximum value.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Unit</td>
<td>The unit of measurement to assign to the reported chart values label that appears along the Y-axis of the chart. This unit is merely a label and <em>does not</em> change the unit of measurement.
<p>The supported units are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Time - Ranges from yoctoseconds (ys) to years (yr)</li>
<li>IEC/Binary - data size in IEC/Binary units. Ranges from B (bytes) to YiB</li>
<li>SI - data rate in SI units. Ranges from bps (bits/s) to Ybps</li>
<p>If you select <strong>ICE/Binary Unit Prefixes</strong>, then Wavefront uses 1024 instead of 1000 as the step to the next unit prefix. </p>
</ul>
<p>For details on unit prefixes and dynamic units, see <a href="ui_charts.html#units-in-chart-axes-and-legends">Units in Chart Axes and Legends</a>. </p>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Description Tab

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="60%">
Chart description. The description shows up as hover text when you place the mouse over the chart name.</td>
<td width="40%"><img src="/images/description_hover_text.png" alt="description of chart"/></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Advanced Tab

<table>
<tbody>
<thead>
<tr><th width="20%">Option</th><th width="80%">Description</th></tr>
</thead>
<tr>
<td>Include Obsolete Metrics</td>
<td>Select this check box to display metrics that have not reported data values in the last 4 weeks. Selecting this option is useful if you are looking at data from 4 or more weeks ago; however, performance is slower when this option is turned on.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

##  Markdown Chart

A **Markdown** chart allows you to provide in-depth text descriptions of a dashboard and individual charts. We support [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/)

In addition to Markdown formatted text, you can use links, images hosted outside Wavefront, and [dashboard variables](dashboards_variables_v2.html). You can refer to the value of a dashboard variable with the query variable syntax **${var_name}** and the label of the variable using **%{var_name}**. Using a label instead of the variable value could be useful for list variables that might show the dropdown labels such as: Any, 1 Year, 3 Years which could map to opaque values such as -1, 1, 3.
