These release notes give an overview of the changes for the 2021-20.x to 2021-24.x releases of the VMware Tanzu Observability (formerly known as VMware Aria Operations for Applications) service.

## 2021-24.x Release Notes

* **PromQL Improvement**: Using global filters (key-value pairs for filtering results) is now supported for charts created with PromQL queries.
* **Accessibility Improvements**: We have made a number of keyboard navigation and focus indicator fixes.
* **Documentation Improvements**: Reorganized the information about [alerts](alerts.html).

## 2021-23.x Release Notes

* **cumulativePercentile() Function**: For histograms that come from Prometheus, you can now use [the `cumulativePercentile()` function](ts_cumulativePercentile.html) to calculate the cumulative percentile value.
* **List Variables**: List variables now support [non-alphanumeric characters](dashboards_variables.html#supported-characters).
* **Alert Status for services**: Active alerts are now shown on the [Application Status page](tracing_ui_overview.html) in all formats (grid view, table view, app map).
  ![Shows the red dot on a service on the app map view. This indicates that an alert is firing for that service. To see the alert, click actions and view alerts. ](images/tracing_alerts_on_app_map_release_notes.png)



## 2021-22.x Release Notes

* **CSV Export Improvements**: Significant improvements to the [CSV Export functionality](ui_examine_data.html#export-to-csv-or-pdf) for table charts make it easy to open the exported data in a spreadsheet.

## 2021-21.x Release Notes

* **OpenTelemetry Exporter**: The [Tanzu Observability (Wavefront) exporter for OpenTelemetry](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/exporter/tanzuobservabilityexporter/README.md) allows you to send traces to Wavefront and use our [comprehensive DT GUI](tracing_ui_overview.html) to visualize trace data.
<!---The KB [OpenTracing or OpenTelemetry- Which to select for instrumenting applications for tracing](/articles/360058140212-OpenTracing-or-OpenTelemetry-Which-specification-to-select-for-instrumenting-applications-for-tracing-) gives an introduction.--->
* **PromQL Improvements**:  We made the following improvements to our PromQL implementation:
  - Regular expression filters in PromQL are now supported.
  - Regular subquery expressions in PromQL are now supported.
  The earlier limitations have been removed from our [PromQL doc page](wavefront_prometheus.html).
* **New Function**: We now support a [log2() function](ts_log2.html) in addition to the existing log() and log10() functions.
* **Alert API Change**: Performing a PUT request with no changes against `/api/v2/alert/{id}` no longer marks the alert as edited/auto resolved.
* **Search UI Improvements**:
  - You can explicitly exclude a keyword or a phrase from the search results by changing the equal sign to a not equal sign (â‰ ). See [Searching Wavefront](wavefront_searching.html) for an example.

  - When you search, we now show results that contain the current text string, as shown in the following screenshot.

  ![search has results of full string and results that include the text string, starting with Contains](images/contains.png)




## 2021-20.x Release Notes

* **Performance Improvements**: This release includes significant performance improvements for the query language. As part of this project, our engineers added single-side join improvements, strategy improvements for TopK, and more. Read our blog post: [How Tanzu Observability Continuous Improvement Makes You More Successful](https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/vmware-tanzu-observability-blog/how-tanzu-observability-continuous-improvement-make-you-more-successful) for details.

* **New Functions**: We added the [`retainDimension()` and `removeDimension()` functions](ts_retainDimension_removeDimension.html), which allow you to keep or remove dimensions (point tags) that are in the results of your queries.

* **New Operators**: We add the `groupLeft` and `groupRight` operators, which let you achieve many-to-one and one-to-many series matching, similar to the [Many-to-one and one-to-many PromQL vector matches](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/operators/#many-to-one-and-one-to-many-vector-matches). To learn more about how to use these operators and how Wavefront processes output metadata from a series match, see [Processing Output Metadata from a Series Match](query_language_series_matching.html#processing-output-metadata-from-a-series-match).
