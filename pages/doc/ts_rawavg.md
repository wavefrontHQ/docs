## Summary
```
rawavg(<tsExpression>[,metrics|sources|sourceTags|pointTags|<pointTagKey>])
```
Returns the raw average (mean) of the time series described by the expression.
The results are computed from real reported data values only.
Use [`avg()`](ts_avg.html) to include interpolated values.

## Description

The `rawavg()` aggregation function averages the data values reported at each moment in time, across the time series that are represented by the expression.

By default, `rawavg()` returns a single series of averages by aggregating data values across all time series. You can optionally group the time series based on one or more characteristics, and obtain a separate series of averages for each group.

A raw average is computed only from real values reported at a given moment in time.
No interpolation is performed to fill in data gaps in any time series.
Use [`avg()`](ts_avg.html) if you want the averages to include interpolated values wherever possible. Using `rawavg()` instead of `avg()` can significantly improve query performance.

### Grouping

Like all aggregation functions, `rawavg()` returns a single series of results by default. You can include a 'group by' parameter to obtain separate raw averages for groups of time series that share common metric names, source names, source tags, point tags, or values for a particular point tag key.
The function returns a separate series of results corresponding to each group.

You can specify multiple 'group by' parameters to group the time series based on multiple characteristics. For example, `rawavg(ts("cpu.cpu*"), metrics, Customer)` first groups by metric names, and then groups by the values of the `Customer` point tag.

{% include note.html content="Starting with the 2023-20.x release, grouping is case-sensitive. For example, if you ingest point tags such as `zone` and `ZONE`, when you use an aggregation function and apply grouping, we will consider `zone` and `ZONE` as separate tags. " %}

## Example

The following example shows the data for `sample.requests.loadavg`. To limit the number of lines, we're filtering to show only time series with `env=dev`.

When we apply `rawavg()` we get a single line.
