## Description

You can use `avg()`:
* With time series as an aggregation function.
* With histogram series as a conversion function.

### Time-Series Aggregation Function

The `avg()` aggregation function averages the data values at each moment in time, across the time series that are represented by the expression.

By default, `avg()` produces a single series of averages by aggregating values across all time series. You can optionally group the time series based on one or more characteristics, and obtain a separate series of averages for each group.

If any time series has data gaps, `avg()` fills them in by interpolation whenever possible.

The `avg()`, `mavg()` and `mmedian()` functions can help you understand the tendency of the data.

* Use `avg()` or `mavg()` to get the mean (average), that is, the number in the middle of a set of values.
* Use `mmedian()` to be less sensitive to outliers. Even a single outlier can affect the result of `avg()` and `mavg()`. Use `mpercentile()` with a percentile of 50 to get the moving median.


#### Grouping

Like all aggregation functions, `avg()` returns a single series of results by default.
You can include a `group by` parameter to obtain separate averages for groups of time series that share common metric names, source names, source tags, point tags, or values for a particular point tag key.
The function returns a separate series of results corresponding to each group.

You can specify multiple 'group by' parameters to group the time series based on multiple characteristics. For example, `avg(ts("cpu.cpu*"), metrics, Customer)` first groups by metric names, and then groups by the values of the `Customer` point tag.

{% include note.html content="Starting with the 2023-20.x release, grouping is case-sensitive. For example, if you ingest point tags such as `zone` and `ZONE`, when you use an aggregation function and apply grouping, we will consider `zone` and `ZONE` as separate tags. " %}

#### Interpolation
If any time series has gaps in its data, the query engine attempts to fill these gaps with interpolated values before applying the function.
A value can be interpolated into a time series only if at least one other time series reports a real data value at the same moment in time.

Within a given time series, an interpolated value is calculated from two real reported values on either side of it.
Sometimes interpolation is not possible--for example, when a new value has not been reported yet in a live-view chart.
In this case, the query engine finds the last known reported value in the series, and assigns it to any subsequent moment in time for which a real reported data value is present in some other time series. We use the last known reported value only if interpolation canâ€™t occur _and_ if the last known reported value has been reported within the last 15% of the query time in the chart window.

You can use [`rawavg()`](ts_rawavg.html) to suppress interpolation.  See [Standard Versus Raw Aggregation Functions](query_language_aggregate_functions.html).

### Histogram Conversion Function

The `avg()` histogram conversion function computes the average of the data values in each distribution of a histogram series that is represented by the expression. The averages for a given histogram series are returned as a separate time series that contains a data point corresponding to each input distribution.

`avg()` is a histogram conversion function because it takes histogram distributions as input, and returns time series. You can therefore use a histogram conversion function as a `tsExpression` parameter in a time series query function.


## Examples

### Time-Series Aggregation Function

The following example shows the data for `sample.requests.loadavg`. To limit the number of lines, we're filtering to show only time series with `env=dev`.

![metric filtered](images/ts_avg_before.png)

When we apply `avg()` we get a single line.

![avg](images/ts_avg.png)

We can group by the `env()` point tag to see the differences between the dev and production servers.

### Histogram Conversion Function

In the following example, the blue line shows the result of applying `avg()` to an `hsExpression`. In this particular example, the average is nearly always the same as the median (the red line), with some divergent values around 2:40p.

![hs avg](images/hs_avg.png)

**Note:**  `avg()` returns a separate time series for each input histogram series. In this example, the `hsExpression` represents a single histogram series, so the result is a single time series. (In contrast, when `avg()` is applied to a `tsExpression`, a single returned time series might be the result of combining multiple input time series.)


## Caveats for Time Series

Using [`rawavg()`](ts_rawavg.html) instead of `avg()` can significantly improve query performance because `rawavg()` does not perform interpolation.
