summary: Learn about new and updated features in the Wavefront 2017-16.x release.
---

The Wavefront 2017-16.x release has a number of UI enhancements to improve searchability of metrics and sources in dashboards. All AWS cloud integration types have been significantly expanded, with many new metrics, new source, event, and point tags, and a metric fetch rate configuration option. Webhooks have been enhanced to better handle large notification payloads and added alert tags. Finally, we've added 3 tutorials to help new users get started.

- **Release numbering** - The release numbering scheme has changed from **X.Y** to **YYYY-WW** and reflects a shift to a more frequent release model. The **WW** component of the release number is the week when development on the set of features delivered in the release was completed.
- **Dashboards**
  - The All Dashboards page now supports searching for dashboards that reference specific metrics and sources. In addition to indexing simple metric references, metrics in a dashboard that use wildcards are also expanded to the full set. For example, a query used in a dashboard may contain `cpu.*`. When searching for metrics, you could search for cpu idle.

  When you type a string in the Search area at the top of the page, matching metrics and sources display in Metrics and Sources groups respectively. For example:

    ![db search](images/db_search_metrics.png)

    Clicking a result filters the list of dashboards to show all dashboards with queries that reference that metric or source.
  - You can now step through the filter history in the All Dashboards page using the browser back button.
- **Agent and Proxy** - the renaming of agent to proxy started in recent releases has been completed.
  - The Agent category in the Wavefront API v2 has been renamed Proxy.
  - [Proxy metrics](wavefront_monitoring.html) historically had the prefix `~agent`. The query engine now supports both `~proxy` and `~agent` prefixes.  Query errors still refer only to the `~agent` prefix, for example: `No metrics matching: [~agent.points.*.received]`.
  - The default name of a proxy in the Proxies page is now `Proxy on <hostname>`.
- **AWS cloud integrations**
  - The AWS CloudWatch integration now allows you to [configure](integrations_aws_metrics.html#configuring-cloudwatch-metric-ingestion) how often Wavefront fetches metrics from CloudWatch.
  - The AWS EC2 integration has been renamed AWS Metrics+ to reflect the fact that metrics are retrieved from many AWS services.
  - [Tagging](tags_overview.html) enhancements - to improve searchability, various types of tags have been added to sources, events, and metrics imported from AWS:
    - AWS CloudTrail events now have the event tag `aws.cloudtrail.ec2`.
    - The `aws.reservedInstance.count` metric now has a point tag, `operatingSystem`, which tracks whether the AWS instance is running Windows or Linux.
  - Detached volumes are now reported in the `aws.ebs.volumesize` metric. The source is set to the volume ID. AWS EBS metrics now have the `volumeType` and `Status` point tags. For details, see [AWS Metrics Integration](integrations_aws_metrics.html#aws-metrics-integration.html).
  - Pricing Metrics - capture the current pricing of EC2 instances. These metrics are available as a preview and subject to change. These metrics have the point tags  `instanceType`, `operatingSystem`, `Region`, `purchaseOption` (All Upfront, Partial Upfront, No Upfront), `leaseContractLength` (1 or 3 years), and `offeringClass` (standard or convertible)).`source` is set to the display name of the region. For example, if `Region=us-west2`, then `source=us west (oregon)`.
    - `~sample.aws.ec2.on-demand.price.hourly` - the hourly price (in US$) of an on-demand instance.
    - `~sample.aws.ec2.reserved.price.upfront` - the up-front payment for a reservation (in US$).  This metric reports a `0` in cases where `purchaseOption` is `No Upfront`.
    - `~sample.aws.ec2.reserved.price.hourly` - the hourly payment for a reservation (in US$). This metric reports `0` in cases where the purchaseOption is `All Upfront`.
  - Support added for the AWS Canada (Central) Region. The AWS integration now includes all AWS regions.
- **Webhooks**
  - Added support for handling large notifications in webhooks. When a large number of sources is associated with an alert, a webhook call can potentially have a very large payload (since all the sources are listed in the payload). For some webhook integrations this large payload can result in failure of the webhook call and the resulting notification being lost. The same problem could happen with other lists of items associated with an alert and available as list variables in the Wavefront mustache template. Each webhook implementation may have different limits in payload size. Payload functions allow you to configure the number of items returned in any list and query whether the limit is reached. See [Payload Functions](webhooks_alert_notification.html#payload-functions) and [Setting and Testing Iteration Limits](webhooks_alert_notification.html#setting-and-testing-iteration-limits).
  - Alert tags are now available to webhooks.
- **Tutorials** - new [getting started tutorials](label_tutorials.html).
- **Mobile platforms** - to make data entry easier on mobile platforms, input fields no longer automatically capitalize the the first letter of metrics, tags, etc.
