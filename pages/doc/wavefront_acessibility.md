VMware Aria Operations for Applications (formerly known as Tanzu Observability by Wavefront) is committed to continuous improvement of product accessibility. We recently addressed accessibility issues and included level-A accessibility fixes for keyboard navigation and colorblind support. We also addressed several level-AA accessibility issues. Here are some highlights:

* Keyboard shortcuts allow you to navigate through pages and menus without using a mouse.
* Color contrast supports colorblind accessibility. We continuously check our UI elements and change color as needed.

## Accessibility Improvements

Starting with the 2021-26.x release, we included these accessibility improvements:

* More color contrast improvements to support colorblind accessibility, for example in all charts and dashboards, including operational and service dashboards.
* A redesigned color picker with a new color palette.
  * Light UI theme:

  * Dark UI theme:

* Keyboard navigation support in more UI pages.
* Drag-and-drop functionality that allows you to rearrange items.

## Drag-and-Drop Keyboard Navigation

The drag-and-drop keyboard navigation is available when you create or edit charts and when you create or edit metrics security policies.

To use the drag-and-drop navigation:

1. To enter drag mode, press **spacebar**.
2. Use the arrow keys to move the item, for example a query line.
3. Press **spacebar** to drop the item in its new position.

With the drag-and-drop keyboard navigation you can rearrange:

* Query lines
* Functions within a query line in Query Editor
* Variables
* List values when you add variables to a dashboard
* Metrics Security Policy rules
