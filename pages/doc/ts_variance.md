## Summary
```
variance(<tsExpression>[,metrics|sources|sourceTags|pointTags|<pointTagKey>])
```
Returns the variance based on the set of time series described by the expression.
The results might be computed from real reported values and interpolated values.
Use [`rawvariance()`](ts_rawvariance.html) if you don't need interpolation.

## Description

The `variance()` aggregation function computes the variance among data values at each moment in time, across the time series that are represented by the expression.

By default, `variance()` produces a single series of variances by aggregating data values across all time series. You can optionally group the time series based on one or more characteristics, and obtain a separate series of variances for each group.

If any time series has data gaps, `variance()` fills them in by interpolation whenever possible.

### Grouping

Like all aggregation functions, `variance()` returns a single series of results by default.  You can include a `group by` parameter to compute separate variances based on groups of time series that share common metric names, source names, source tags, point tags, or values for a particular point tag key.
The function returns a separate series of results corresponding to each group.

You can specify multiple 'group by' parameters to group the time series based on multiple characteristics. For example, `variance(ts("cpu.cpu*"), metrics, Customer)` first groups by metric names, and then groups by the values of the `Customer` point tag.

{% include note.html content="Starting with the 2023-20.x release, grouping is case-sensitive. For example, if you ingest point tags such as `zone` and `ZONE`, when you use an aggregation function and apply grouping, we will consider `zone` and `ZONE` as separate tags. " %}

### Interpolation

If any time series has gaps in its data, the query engine attempts to fill these gaps with interpolated values before applying the function.
A value can be interpolated into a time series only if at least one other time series reports a real data value at the same moment in time.

Within a given time series, an interpolated value is calculated from two real reported values on either side of it.
Sometimes interpolation is not possible--for example, when a new value has not been reported yet in a live-view chart.
In this case, the query engine finds the last known reported value in the series, and assigns it to any subsequent moment in time for which a real reported data value is present in some other time series. We use the last known reported value only if interpolation canâ€™t occur _and_ if the last known reported value has been reported within the last 15% of the query time in the chart window.

You can use [`rawvariance()`](ts_rawvariance.html) to suppress interpolation.  See [Standard Versus Raw Aggregation Functions](query_language_aggregate_functions.html).
