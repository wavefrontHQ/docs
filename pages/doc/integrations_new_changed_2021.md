summary: New and changed Wavefront integrations released in 2021
---
VMware Aria Operations for Applications (formerly known as Tanzu Observability by Wavefront) continuously adds new integrations to the existing set, and improves available integrations.

This document lists new and changed integrations for 2021. For earlier releases, see [New and Changed Integrations in 2019-2020](integrations_new_changed_2020.html).
* We have a separate document for [Integrations Release Notes](integrations_new_changed.html).
* We update our [list of all integrations](https://docs.wavefront.com/label_integrations%20list.html) each time we add new integrations.


## December 2021

We added the following integration in December 2021:

* vRealize Operations Integration v1 

  This initial version of the integration currently fetches only vCenter Server adapter resources, such as Cluster Compute Resource and Datastore. We will add more features to this integration in future releases. For information about setting up the integration, the current limitations and caveats, see [vRealize Operations Integration Overview](integrations_vrops.html).
  
* Photon OS Host
  
  Now you can monitor hosts running Photon OS. Photon OS is an open-source minimalist Linux operating system from VMware that is optimized for cloud computing platforms, VMware vSphere deployments, and applications native to the cloud.
  
Made improvements to the following integrations and dashboards in December 2021:

* Kubernetes -- Updated the **Kubernetes Collector Troubleshooting** dashboard to communicate the proxy version.
* Tanzu Application Service -- Added a new out-of-the-box dashboard to monitor the doppler server.
* Microsoft Azure -- Updated the setup steps for getting the application ID.


## November 2021

We added the following integration in November 2021:

* AVI Networks

  Now, NSX Advance Load Balancer (AVI Networks) can be monitored by using out-of-the-box dashboards provided in the AVI Networks (NSX ALB) integration tile. This integration is developed and created by the community and falls into to the new **Community Integrations** section of the Wavefront **Integrations** page. This is the first integration in this category. We do not validate the community integrations and they are not fully supported by the Tanzu Observability by Wavefront team.

Made improvements to the following integrations and dashboards in November 2021:

* Data Platforms -- Made query updates in health charts under the Mission Control section.
* Kubernetes:
  * Updated the queries in the dashboard charts to show correct values in single stat charts.
  * Updated the queries in the dashboards to fix NO DATA issues.
* Tanzu Application Service -- Updated the Gorouter dashboard with new charts that show Gorouter metrics in histograms and monitor the router health.
* RabbitMQ -- Updated the RabbitMQ integration and added an out-of-the-box dashboard and setup steps to monitor Rabbit MQ on Kubernetes.
* Redis -- Updated the Redis integration and added an out-of-the-box dashboard and setup steps to monitor Redis on Kubernetes.


## October 2021

Made improvements to the following integrations and dashboards in October 2021:

* Tanzu GemFire -- Updated the Tanzu GemFire integration setup steps and added a new out-of-the-box dashboard to monitor Tanzu GemFire standalone deployment.
* Kubernetes -- Made fixes to queries, so that they show correct values for the Wavefront Collector and Wavefront proxy restarts.
* Azure Kubernetes -- Made fixes to queries, so that they show correct values for running and pending pods.
* Envoy Proxy -- Added an out-of-the-box dashboard and setup steps to monitor Envoy proxy on Kubernetes.

## September 2021

Made improvements to the following integrations and dashboards in September 2021:

* Pivotal Cloud Foundry:
  - We now have Tanzu Application Service integration to support Tanzu Application Service 2.9 and later. We deprecated the Pivotal Cloud Foundry Integration as part of the renaming of Pivotal Cloud Foundry to Tanzu Application Service. The Pivotal Cloud Foundry integration which supports versions 2.2 to 2.8 is moved to the list of Archived integrations.

    {% include note.html content="If you already have installed the Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) alerts, and want to migrate to the Tanzu Application Service integration, uninstall the PCF alerts, so that you don't have duplicate versions of the same alerts. See [installing and uninstalling integration alerts](integrations.html#installing-and-uninstalling-integration-alerts). Note that any changes to the PCF alerts that you have made will not be migrated and will be lost. You have to apply them manually after setting up the Tanzu Application Service integration." %}

    As a best practice, we recommend that you uninstall all PCF Dashboards before migrating to the Tanzu Application Service integration. See [installing and uninstalling integration dashboards](integrations.html#installing-and-uninstalling-integration-dashboards).

  - Optimized the filter queries in the out-of-the-box Tanzu Application Service (Pivotal Cloud Foundry) dashboards.

* Microsoft Azure -- Added new out of the box dashboards:
  * **Azure: Cosmos DB** dashboard for monitoring Azure Cosmos DB.
  * **Summary** dashboard that gives a high-level view of the Azure environment.
* Istio -- Updated the Istio setup instructions with mandatory metric configuration.
* vSphere -- Updated the default configuration to add custom attributes to the metrics.
* Linux Host -- Updated the summary section to use Gauge charts and fixed some errors in a couple of charts.

     ```
     [[inputs.mem]]
       name_prefix="win."
     ```
