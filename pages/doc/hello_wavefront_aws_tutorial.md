summary: Get data from a Windows host or Amazon Web Services.
---

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:
1. Log in to Tanzu Observability by Wavefront.
2. Send data from applications and services that run on your AWS account.
3. Visualize data with preconfigured dashboards and charts.

It's an easy setup. You don't have to install anything or make changes to your application code.

{% include tip.html content="Don't have an AWS account? You can [send data from a Windows environment](#video-set-up-data-ingestion-from-windows). Or you can explore dashboards with sample data. [Log in](#task-1-log-in-to-your-wavefront-instance), click **Integrations** and search for **Tutorial** or **Tour Pro**." %}

## Task 1: Log In to Your Wavefront Instance

If you've never logged in to your company's Wavefront instance, follow these steps. Go to Task 2 otherwise.

1. Check your email! When your administrator adds you to the Wavefront instance, you receive an email with the subject that includes `You have been invited by <email> to Wavefront!`.
2. Click the link in the email.
  * In some environments, you set up your password and you're done.
  * If your admin has configured Single Sign-On (SSO), you're redirected to your company's SSO environment. When you complete the authentication steps, you're redirected to the Wavefront instance.
3. Going forward, you can log in using the `https://<my_instance>.wavefront.com` URL. The Wavefront instance name is in the invitation email.

## Task 2: Set Up the Integration

In this guide, we'll set up a data ingestion pipeline with AWS.

### Step 1: Start Integration Setup

1. Click **Integrations** on the toolbar.
   An integration tile has:
   * A **Setup** tab which provides step-by-step instructions on ingesting data.
   * A **Dashboards** tab to access the out-of-the-box dashboards.
   Popular integrations also have an **Alerts** tab with preconfigured alerts.
2. Click the **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** tile.
    <!--![Highlight the AWS integration on the Wavefront Integrations page.](images/hello_tutorial_aws_integration_tile.png)-->
3. Click the **Setup** tab and click **Add Integration**.
    ![Highlights the Add Integration button on the AWS integration's Setup tab.](images/hello_tutorial_aws_add_integration.png)

You'll see **Account ID** and **External ID** under **How to get Role ARN**. You'll need them to set up the integration.

### Step 2: Create a Wavefront Read-Only Role in Your AWS Account

{{site.data.alerts.note}}
<p>For this step, you need to log in to your AWS account. Create a new AWS account if you don’t have one.</p>
{{site.data.alerts.end}}

Follow these steps:

1. In a web browser, log in to your AWS account.
1. Search for the **IAM** (AWS Identity and Access Management) service and click it to open the service.
1. Click **Roles** in the left panel and click **Create role**.
1. Create aa trusted entity:
    1. Click the **AWS Account** tile and select **Another AWS account**.
    1. Enter the **Account ID**: Copy the **Account ID** value shown in the AWS integration setup instructions and paste it here.
        ![A diagram that shows where the account ID is on the Wavefront integration and an arrow pointing how to copy and paste on the AWS account.](images/hello_tutorial_aws_account_ID.png)
    1. Select **Require external ID**.
        ![A screenshot of the external ID option selected.](images/hello_tutorial_aws_external_ID_selected.png)
    1. Enter the **External ID**. 
    
       Copy the **External ID** value shown in the AWS integration setup instructions and paste it here.
        ![A diagram that shows where the external ID is on the Wavefront integration and an arrow pointing how to copy and paste on the AWS account.](images/hello_tutorial_aws_external_ID.png)
    1. Click **Next**.
1. Set Permissions:
    1. Search for the **ReadOnlyAccess** permission and select it.
        {% include note.html content="You get many results when you search for ReadOnlyAccess. Scroll down until you find ReadOnlyAccess, as shown in the screenshot below."%}
        ![A screenshot that shows the ReadOnlyAccess permission selected.](images/hello_tutorial_readonly_permission.png)
    1. Click **Next**.

1. Set the **Role name** as `wavefront`.
1. Click **Create role**.
1. Once the list of roles appears, click **wavefront** (the role that you just created), and copy the **ARN** value.

{% include note.html content="See [Giving Limited Access](integrations_aws_overview.html#giving-limited-access) if you want to specify a more restrictive IAM policy." %}

### Step 3: Configure the AWS Integration

Go back to the Wavefront instance where you opened the AWS integration tile, and follow these steps:

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="50%">
<ol><li>Paste the <strong>Role ARN</strong> value you copied in the previous step as the value for <strong>“Role ARN” from Amazon IAM</strong>. </li>
<li>Click <strong>Register</strong>. </li>
</ol>
</td>
<td width="50%" markdown="span">![Screenshot of the AWS integration's configure section. The Register button is highlighted in red.](images/hell_tutorial_configure_aws_integration.png) </td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Tanzu Observability by Wavefront can now connect to your AWS account and get data. Once the data starts flowing, you can visualize them. It will take a few minutes for the data to show.

### Step 4: (Optional) Launch an EC2 Instance

Don't have an application running on your AWS account? Follow the steps given below.
If you already have an application running on the AWS account, move to the next step and see how you can visualize your data.

1. Go back to your AWS account, search for the **EC2** service, and click it to open the service.
1. Follow the AWS documentation on [Launching an Amazon EC2 Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html#ec2-launch-instance).

<!--
1. Select **Launch Instance** and click **Launch Instance**.
    ![Screenshot showing the launch instance.](images/hello_tutorial_launch_instance.png)
1. Select **Free tier only** on the left panel and click **Select** on the image you want to run.
      {% include important.html content="You may still be charged for the use of some AWS products unless your infrastructure and service choices remain within the free usage tier. Therefore, make sure it is free to use." %}
1. Follow the steps to launch the instance.
1. You can select **proceed without a key pair** when prompted to select or create a new key pair.
      {% include important.html content="When you select **proceed without a key pair**, you are not able to SSH into the EC2 instance you deploy. Only use it for this tutorial, as it is not a recommended approach." %}
-->
Once the instance is launched, you start to see the data after a few minutes.

## Task 4: Set Up and Use an Out-of-the-Box Alert

Many integrations have preconfigured alerts for common use cases. All you have to do is:
* Clone the alert.
* Set the threshold(s) (for most alerts).
* Specify who should get the alert.

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="50%" markdown="span">
1. Navigate to the Integrations page.
2. Click on the integration that you want to use.
   A configured integration has a green tick in the top right.
</td>
<td width="50%" markdown="span">![Screenshot of several integrations, icon with green tick in top right](images/featured_integrations.png) </td></tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">
3. Click the <strong>Alerts</strong> tab and click <strong>Install All</strong>. Here's an example screenshot from the AWS integration. Not all integrations have preconfigured alerts.
<br/><br/>
You could now edit the alert directly, but we recommend that you clone the alert so you don't interfere with someone else's work.
</td>
<td width="50%" markdown="span">![Screenshot shows AWS integration, Alerts tab selected](images/aws_alerts_install.png) </td></tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">
4. Select <strong>Alerts</strong> in the task bar and search for the alert by name.
   <br/><br/>In this example, we clone the <strong>EC2 Instance CPU Usage Too High</strong> alert. The alert opens in Edit mode.
</td>
<td width="50%" markdown="span">![Screenshot shows AWS integration, Alerts tab selected](images/clone_aws_alert.png) </td></tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%" >
5. Customize the thresholds, for example, you could set up the alert to be SEVERE if 97% of CPU utilization is reached.
6. Scroll to the <strong>Recipients</strong> section. For the lowest severity level that you want notification for:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Click the plus (+) icon.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Type your email address.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Press Enter.<br/>
<br/>
</td>
<td width="50%" markdown="span">![Screenshot shows AWS integration, Alerts tab selected](images/aws_specify_recipient.png) </td></tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%" >
When the threshold is exceeded, you'll now receive an email that includes a link to the alert in the alert viewer. <br/><br/>The annotated screenshot on the right gets you started. <br/><br/>This <a href="https://vmwaretv.vmware.com/embed/secure/iframe/entryId/1_qdr0dtwr/uiConfId/49694343/pbc/252649793/st/0#">short video</a> shows what you can do.
