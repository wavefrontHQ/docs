Starting July 3, 2023, VMware Aria Operations for Applications is a service on the VMware Cloud services platform. If your Operations for Applications instance is onboarded to VMware Cloud services, VMware Cloud services provides access management for your applications that must authenticate with tokens to your Operations for Applications environment. 

{% include note.html content="All new Operations for Applications service instances from July 3, 2023 onwards are onboarded to VMware Cloud services. We are in the process of incrementally onboarding the existing Operations for Applications instances to VMware Cloud services."%}
