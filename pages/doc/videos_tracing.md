Wavefront supports distributed tracing with third-party apps such as Jaeger or you can instrument your app with one of the Wavefront SDKs. Watch these videos for more information.

<p>Clement first explains how you can visualize traces collected with Jaeger and Zipkin with the Wavefront UI. He then uses the example of monitoring a ride sharing app where a single trace includes apps on the user’s phone, the driver’s phone, etc. You can visualize the different components with the Wavefront tracing UI - and also use our UI to drill down on potential problems. Because we’re Open Tracing compliant, you can customize the trace with our SDKs and then look at aggregated information that shows how things are connected.  </p>

      This short video highlights the features of the Traces Browser. You can query traces, filter traces, examine Request, Error, and Duration (RED) metrics of a service on the service map, identify the critical path, see span logs, and much more using the Traces Browser.

      This video highlights the application map features and settings. The application map gives you an overview of how the applications and services are linked, lets you focus on a specific service, view Request, Error, and Duration (RED) metrics for each service, and the tracing traffic in the application. You can also drill down to the Service Dashboard and Tracing Browser.
