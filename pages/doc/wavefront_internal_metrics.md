summary: Tanzu Observability (formerly known as VMware Aria Operations for Applications)) collects internal metrics that are used extensively in the different dashboards of the Tanzu Observability Usage integration.
---

You can:

* Clone and modify one of the Tanzu Observability Usage integration dashboards.
* Create your own dashboard, query these metrics in charts, and create alerts for some of these metrics.

## Internal Metrics Overview

We collect the following sets of metrics.

- `~alert*` -- a set of metrics that allows you to examine the effect of alerts on your service instance.
- `~collector` -- metrics processed at the collector gateway to the service instance. Includes spans.
- `~metric` -- total unique sources and metrics.  You can compute the rate of metric creation from each source.
- `~proxy` -- metric rate received and sent from each Wavefront proxy, blocked and rejected metric rates, buffer metrics, and JVM stats of the proxy. Also includes counts of metrics affected by the proxy preprocessor. See [Monitor Wavefront Proxies](monitoring_proxies.html).
- `~wavefront` -- set of gauges that track metrics about your use of the Tanzu Observability service.
- `~http.api` -- namespace for looking at API request metrics.

If you have an [AWS integration](integrations_aws_metrics.html), metrics with the following prefix are available:

- `~externalservices` -- metric rates, API requests, and events from AWS CloudWatch, AWS CloudTrail, and AWS Metrics+.

There's also a metric you can use to monitor ongoing events and make sure the number does not exceed 1000:
- `~events.num-ongoing-events` -- returns the number of [ongoing events](events.html#event-states).


## Useful Internal Metrics for Optimizing Performance

A small set of internal metrics can help you optimize performance and monitor your costs. This section highlights some things to look for - the exact steps depend on how you're using the Tanzu Observability service and on the characteristics of your environment.

Our customer support engineers have found the following metrics especially useful.
