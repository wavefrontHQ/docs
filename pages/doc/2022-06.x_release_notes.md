These release notes give an overview of the changes for the 2022-01.x to 2022-06.x releases of the VMware Aria Operations for Applications (previously known as Tanzu Observability by Wavefront) service.


## 2022-06.x Release Notes

* **Updated the Wavefront REST API Documentation UI**: We've updated our in-product interactive API documentation to use the latest Swagger API console. To access the API documentation, either click the gear icon and select **API Documentation**, or go to `https://<your_cluster_name>/api-docs/ui/`.
* **New Alerts FAQ Page**: Check out the new [Alerts FAQ page](alerts_faq.html) that answers questions like "Why Did My Alert Misfire?" or "When Does an Alert Resolve?".

## 2022-05.x Release Notes

* **Create and Manage Alerts Revamp**: Streamlined experience that improves usability and gives alert creators more options.
  - Straightforward settings during creation and edit.
  - New Runbooks and Triage Dashboard fields help alert recipients resolve the alert.
  - Alert notifications include actionable insights.

  Watch the [Create Alert Video](https://vmwaretv.vmware.com/media/t/1_e655iog1) or look at the new [Create Alert Tutorial](alerts_manage.html#create-alert-tutorial).

  {% include tip.html content="When you open an existing alert for edit, you'll see it in alerts v2 GUI. However, all APIs work as before. "%}
  {% include note.html content="There will be a staggered rollout of this feature over the next few weeks. "%}

* **Turn off Dynamic Dashboard Variable Live Refresh**: Users with **Dashboard** permissions can now toggle whether a dashboard that shows live data performs [refresh of dynamic variables](ui_dashboards.html#turn-off-dynamic-dashboard-variable-live-refresh).

* **Decimal Precision in Charts**: We have included the **Decimal Precision** setting, and you can specify how many digits to show after the decimal point for a number of charts, such as:
    * Line Plot
    * Point Plot
    * Stacked Area
    * Stacked Column
    * Table

  See the [Chart Reference](ui_chart_reference.html) for details.

## 2022-04.x Release Notes

* **Obsolete Metrics Toggle for Dashboards**: You can now [include obsolete metrics](ui_examine_data.html#include-or-exclude-obsolete-metrics) in all charts within a dashboard. Doing so, data that have not been reported for 4 weeks or more are included for all the charts on the dashboard.

   {% include important.html content="Dashboard performance might suffer if you include obsolete metrics. Using the setting for individual charts is recommended."%}

<!---Decided not to make the sample data dashboards widely available. 
* **New Sample Data Dashboards**: We have added new sample data dashboards, that allow you to investigate integrations dashboards and charts that contain sample data for our most used integrations.

   {% include note.html content="The Sample Data Dashboards are currently available to some of our customers. They will become available to all customers within the next releases."%}
--->

* **Set Up and Manage the AWS Integration by Using the API**: Learn how you can [use the Wavefront API to set up and manage the AWS integration](integrations_aws_overview_API.html).

## 2022-03.x Release Notes

We have added a new **API Tokens** permission for user accounts. This change **does not** affect service accounts.

{% include important.html content="All existing users, who were previously able to generate their own API tokens, can still use and manage their existing API tokens. However, going forward, only users who have the **API Tokens** permission can generate new API tokens. "%}
