Tanzu Observability (formerly known as VMware Aria Operations for Applications) provides observability for several different [metric types](metric_types.html) including time series metrics, delta counters, histograms, and traces/spans. This page looks at the anatomy of a time series metric and shows you how to explore it in the Metrics Browser.

## Time Series Metric Structure

A time series has, at a minimum, the metric name, value/timestamp, and source. In many cases, the metric is ingested with additional information represented as tags.

### Simple Time Series

Here's one example that shows the minimum elements of a time series.

![metric, value, timestamp, source](images/metric_anatomy_simple.png)

Each time series is a unique combination of:

* **Metric name**--Describes the metric. There's often a hierarchy of metrics, each with a corresponding time series.
* **Value & Timestamp**--Value at the specified time.
* **Source**--The source of the metric. Host, VM, etc. In contrast to some other observability platforms, this dimension is always part of the metric.

Here's a screenshot of the time series that is shown in the diagram above in a chart.

![screenshot of simple time series corresponding to the metric, value, timestamp, and source used above](images/metric_simple_screenshot.png)

### Time Series with Tags

In most cases, the time series includes one or more tags to allow a more fine-grained analysis. The `~sample` data you can find on each service instance include point tags for environment and availability zone.

![metric, value, timestamp, source, point tag](images/metric_anatomy_with_tag.png)

Point tags offer a powerful way of labeling data so that you can slice and dice it in almost any way you can imagine. For example, you can use point tags, to label a pointâ€™s datacenter, version, etc. and can then group by datacenter or version.

You use point tags to add extra dimensions to your data, and can then focus your exploration just on that dimension.[Fine Tune Queries with Point Tags](query_language_point_tags.html) explains how to use point tags.

Here's a screenshot of the time series that includes point tags in a chart.

![screenshot of time series corresponding to the metric, source, and point tag used in diagram above](images/metric_simple_screenshot.png)

### How Filtering with Tags Improves Usability

How the point tag filters are useful becomes obvious when the `source=` filter is removed. The result of all time series for `~sample.disk.space.used` is visually confusing.

![screenshot of time series ~sample.disk.space.used showing many lines](images/metrics_without_filter.png)

When you add filters for `env` and `az`, the information makes sense.

![screenshot of time series ~sample.disk.space.used filtered by az and env showing fewer lines](images/metrics_with_filter.png)

## Obsolete Metrics

If a metric stops sending data points for a certain period of time (obsolescence period), it becomes **obsolete**. 

{% include note.html content="The obsolescence period for metrics and sources (by default 2 weeks) might vary because it depends on the configuration of your cluster. You can see your current configuration by looking into the Advanced settings of any [chart](ui_charts.html#include-metrics-that-stopped-reporting) or [dashboard](ui_dashboards.html#set-dashboard-display-preferences-and-settings). To change this configuration, contact [Technical Support](wavefront_support_feedback.html)."%}

In the Metrics browser and Query Editor, obsolete metrics are no longer shown in the autocomplete drop-down lists.

## Metrics Browser

Select **Browse > Metrics** to display the Metrics Browser. Use the Metrics Browser to find metrics that are actively sending data points.

{% include note.html content="The Metrics Browser filters out the obsolete metrics." %}

![An annotated screenshot of the Metrics Browser. The information is listed below.](images/metrics_browser.png)

On the Metrics Browser, you can:
* Drill down and go up the hierarchy.
* Filter by name or source.
* Hide and redisplay individual metrics or metrics namespaces to unclutter your page.
* View the metric type in terms of retention period - persistent or ephemeral.
* Convert persistent metrics to ephemeral and the reverse.
* Create a chart or dashboard for an individual metric or for the current set of metrics.
* View the sources and point tags for an individual metric.

{% include tip.html content="If you select **Browse > Delta Counters** you can use the same browser to examine [delta counters](delta_counters.html). The only difference is that counters are persistent and not convertible to ephemeral." %}

### Hide and Redisplay Metrics

While [obsolete metrics](metrics_managing.html#obsolete-metrics) are automatically hidden, you can manually hide metrics from the Metrics browser. Manually hiding metrics does not permanently delete a metric or metric namespace.

{% include shared/permissions.html entity="metrics" entitymgmt="Metrics" %}

{% include note.html content="Hidden metrics are removed from the autocomplete drop-down lists, but you can still use these metrics in queries as long as data points exist." %}

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="60%">
<strong>To hide one or more metrics:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Select <strong>Browse > Metrics</strong>.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Manage Hidden Metrics</strong> button.</li>
<li>In the dialog box, type a complete metric name (e.g. <code>requests.latency</code>) or a metric prefix (e.g. <code>requests.</code>, <code>cpu.loadavg.</code>).
<ul>
<li>This field does not support auto-complete, so you have to type the entire metric name or metric prefix.</li>
<li>The text is case sensitive.</li>
<li>Wildcards are not supported. The star <code>*</code> character is considered part of the text string.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Press Enter to add the metric(s) to the list and click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
</ol> </td>
<td width="40%"><img src="/images/hide_metrics.png" alt="hide metrics"></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="60%">
<strong>To view hidden metrics:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Select <strong>Browse > Metrics</strong>.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Manage Hidden Metrics</strong> button.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Unhide</strong> button to the right of the metric or metric prefix to unhide and click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
</ol>
The selected metrics and metric prefixes appear again as long as they are not obsolete.

### Change the Retention Period of Metrics

With the 2024-05 release, we introduce **ephemeral** metrics, which have short [retention period](terms_of_service.html#data-retention). By default, all ingested metrics are persistent but are convertible to ephemeral.

Converting persistent metrics to ephemeral can significantly improve the [query performance](query_language_performance.html) and reduce the [cardinality](cardinality.html).

{% include note.html content="To change the retention period of a metric or metrics namespace, you must be a Super Admin user with [enabled Super Admin mode](users_account_managing.html#enable-or-disable-super-admin-mode)." %}

{% include important.html content="Converting a persistent metric to ephemeral **permanently deletes** the data points of this metric that are older than 28 days." %}

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="60%">
<ol>
<li>Select <strong>Browse > Metrics</strong>.</li>
<li>Click the <strong>Change Ephemerality</strong> button.</li>
<li>To convert a persistent metric or metrics namespace to ephemeral, in the <strong>Select Metric Prefix</strong> text box, enter the target metric name or namespace prefix, and press Enter.
<p>The metric name or namespace prefix appears in the <strong>Ephemeral Metrics</strong> table below. You can repeat this step for multiple metrics and metrics namespaces.</p></li>
<li>To convert an ephemeral metric or metrics namespace to persistent, in the <strong>Ephemeral Metrics</strong> table, locate the target metric or namespace prefix and click the corresponding <strong>Convert to Persistent Metric</strong> action.<p>The metric name or namespace prefix disappears from the <strong>Ephemeral Metrics</strong> table. You can repeat this step for multiple metrics and metrics namespaces.</p></li>
<li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
</ol> </td>
<td width="40%"><img src="/images/change_ephemerality.png" alt="A screenshot of the Change Ephemerality dialog box."></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Changing the retention period of a metric or metrics namespace creates a [System event](events.html):
* Converting a persistent metric to ephemeral creates a System event with the name `Ephemeral Prefix: Added <metric_name>`.
* Converting an ephemeral metric to persistent creates a System event with the name `Ephemeral Prefix: Removed <metric_name>`.
