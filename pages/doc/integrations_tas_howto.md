## Process Overview

We've streamlined the getting started process so it involves a few simple steps -- some are performed in Tanzu Ops Manager, and some in the Wavefront GUI.

![4 steps below shown in an image. First 2 are purple, pivotal, next 2 are blue, wavefront. ](images/tas_to_overview.png)

1. Download the Tanzu Observability by Wavefront nozzle file from the [Tanzu Network](https://network.pivotal.io/)
2. In Tanzu Ops Manager, install, configure, and deploy the nozzle. At a minimum:
    1. In the **Wavefront Proxy Config** section, specify the Wavefront instance and API token (shown in the Wavefront instance in the integration's **Setup** tab) and a user-friendly host name.
   ![OpsMan Proxy Config tab with the 3 required items highlighted](images/tas_to_proxy_config.png)
    2. In the **Telegraf Agent Config** section, specify the Foundation name.<br/><br/>
     See [Ops Manager: Install, Configure, and Deploy the Nozzle](#step-2-ops-manager-install-configure-and-deploy-the-nozzle) and [Tanzu Application Service to Tanzu Observability FAQs](#tanzu-application-service-to-tanzu-observability-faqs)
     After you complete nozzle deployment, metrics are flowing from Tanzu Application Service to the Wavefront proxy and from there to your Wavefront instance. See [Data Flow](#architecture-and-data-flow) below.
3. Log in to your Wavefront instance (for example, `https://example.wavefront.com`) and confirm that metrics are flowing:
   1. Click **Integrations** in the toolbar, search for Tanzu Application Service, and select the integration.
   2. Click the **Metrics** tab and confirm metrics are flowing.
4. With the integration selected, click the **Dashboards** tab.
   1. Select from the set of predefined dashboards, which are modeled on the corresponding Healthwatch dashboards but have additional options. For example, you can examine multiple foundations from one dashboard.
   2. Explore one or two dashboards. [Examine Data with Dashboards and Charts](ui_examine_data.html) has an overview and includes a video.
   3. As appropriate, clone any of the existing dashboards to add charts, modify queries, and more. See [Create, Customize, and Optimize Dashboards](ui_dashboards.html) and [Create and Customize Charts](ui_charts.html)

## Architecture and Data Flow

Here's an overview of the flow of data from the Tanzu Application Service Firehose through the nozzle to the Wavefront service. The nozzle consists of these main components:
- **Healthwatch Exporters**: Exporters are deployed as VMs.
- **Telegraf**: An open source, lightweight server process for collecting, processing, and aggregating metrics.
- [**Wavefront Proxy**](proxies.html): Ingests metrics and forwards them to the
Wavefront service in a secure, fast, and reliable manner

Here's the data pipeline:
1. The Healthwatch Exporter VMs stream metrics from the Tanzu Application Service Firehose. The tile creates a VM for each Healthwatch exporter, a VM for Telegraf, and a VM for the Wavefront proxy.
2. Telegraf scrapes the VMs at a predefined interval, and converts them to [Wavefront data format](wavefront_data_format.html). Telegraf uses a built-in plugin. It uses the Wavefront Go SDK to convert the data.
3. Next, Telegraf sends the data to the Wavefront proxy.
4. The proxy send the metrics to the Wavefront service.

## Tanzu Application Service to Tanzu Observability FAQs

In this section, we have some answers to frequently asked questions.

### How Can I Change the Scrape Interval?

By default, the scrape interval is set to 15 seconds, but you can set up your environment to check more frequently:
1. In Ops Manager, click **Telegraf Agent Config**.
2. Set the **Scrape Interval (seconds)** field and click **Save**.

### How Can I Send TAS Data via a Proxy That Is Deployed Outside the Tile?

Some customers have a central monitoring/observability team that requires that all data to be sent via a specific set of production proxies. Those proxies are used to filter or alter data before they are sent to the Wavefront service.

You can set up your environment to use production proxies as follows:
1. In Ops Manager, click **Telegraf Agent Config**.
2. In **Advanced Options**, select **Yes**.
3. In the Custom Proxy URL field, provide a proxy URL or IP in the Custom Proxy URL. 
    This could also be load balancer URL if the external proxies are behind a load balancer.
4. (Optional) In the **Proxy Port** field, provide a custom proxy port (Default is 2878).
5. Click **Save**.

### How Can I Customize Metrics Ingestion per Component?

If you don't want to monitor some of your TAS platform metrics, you can choose not to send them. If those metrics are monitored with any out-of-the-box or custom dashboards, they show up as No Data.

For example, if you donâ€™t want to ingest certificate expiration metrics, then you can remove the VM instance that is assigned to the Cert Expiration Exporter by default. All the metrics that this exporter scrapes will not get ingested.
1. In Ops Manager, click **Resource Config**.
2. Find the exporter for which you don't want to emit metrics, set it to 0, and click **Save**. 
   
   The screenshot below shows how to do this.

![Cert Expiration Exporter is in process of being changed from Automatic to 0](images/tas_to_resource_config.png)


### How Can I Set Up a Metrics Filter?

If you want to consume only a subset of your metrics, you can use an allow list or block list.

You can specify the filter as follows:

1. In Ops Manager, click **Wavefront Proxy Config**.
2. Scroll down to **Filter metrics by metric name**, and select whether you want to use an allow list or a block list.
3. Enter one or more regular expression patterns for your selected list. 
   
   Each pattern must begin and end with a slash (/) and be on its own line.


### How Can I Further Customize Proxy Behavior?

The Wavefront proxy allows you to control many aspects of your ingestion pipeline with configuration properties and preprocessor rules.
- **Configuration file**: The proxy processes data according to a configuration file. You can modify configuration properties -- for example, to create `block` list and `allow` list regex patterns, specify information about certain data formats, and much more. See [Configuring Wavefront Proxies](proxies_configuring.html).
- **Preprocessor Rules**: Starting with proxy version 4.1, the Wavefront proxy includes a preprocessor that applies user-defined rules before data is sent to the Wavefront service. You can use preprocessor rules to correct certain data quality issues when you can't fix the problem at the emitting source. See [Configuring Wavefront Proxy Preprocessor Rules](proxies_preprocessor_rules.html).

You can specify custom elements as follows:
1. In Ops Manager, click **Wavefront Proxy Config**.
2. Under **Custom Proxy Config**, click **Custom**.
3. Make your changes and click **Save**.

### Things Aren't Working. What Can I Do?

Ensure that your environment meet requirements on the Ops Manager side and on the Tanzu Observability side.
* **Ops Manager Requirements**
  VMware Tanzu Observability by Wavefront nozzle has the following requirements:
  *	Read-only access to the Doppler Firehose and Cloud Controller.
  * Access to a Wavefront instance and an API token. [Service Account API token](wavefront_api.html#generating-an-api-token) is recommended.
* **Tanzu Observability by Wavefront Requirements**
  To set up the Tanzu Application Service integration on you Wavefront instance, you must have:
  * Access to a Wavefront instance with a URL like `https://example.wavefront.com`.
  * At a minimum, **Integrations** permission on that Wavefront instance.
  * This version of the Tanzu Observability by Wavefront nozzle is compatible with Wavefront proxy version 10.14 and later.

See [Tanzu Observability and TAS Troubleshooting](tas_to_troubleshooting.html) for more.

## Process Details

This section explains each step in the flow in detail.

### Prerequisites

* You must have a Tanzu Network account to configure the Tanzu Observability Nozzle in Ops Manager.
* You must have login credentials for a Wavefront instance to configure the integration.
* Ensure that the root certificate for Ops Manager is included in data coming from Tanzu Application Service. See the [No Data Flowing and Certificate Error](tas_to_troubleshooting.html#symptom-no-data-flowing-in-and-certificate-error) troubleshooting section.


### Step 1: Download the Nozzle File

Download the Tanzu Observability by Wavefront nozzle file from the [Tanzu Network](https://network.pivotal.io/) to your local filesystem. You must have a Tanzu Network account to perform this task.

### Step 2: Ops Manager: Install, Configure, and Deploy the Nozzle

**To install the nozzle:**

1. Download the VMware Tanzu Observability TAS tile version 4 from [VMware Tanzu Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/wavefront-nozzle/).
2. Log in to Ops Manager, select **Installation Dashboard**, click **Import a Product**, and upload the file you just downloaded.
3. Under  **Import a Product**, click the plus sign (+) next to the version number of VMware Tanzu Observability by Wavefront nozzle.

{% include important.html content="As a final step, you must deploy the nozzle to get data flowing. Deployment usually takes about 30 minutes. The nozzle tile turns from orange to green when deployment is successful. "%}

### Step 3: Check That Metrics are Flowing and Examine Your Data

Log in to your Wavefront instance (for example, `https://example.wavefront.com`) and confirm that metrics are flowing:
1. Click **Integrations** in the toolbar, search for Tanzu Application Service, and select the integration.
2. Click the **Metrics** tab and confirm metrics are flowing.

### Step 4: Use  Dashboard to Examine Your Data

1. With the integration selected, click the **Dashboards** tab.
2. Select from the set of predefined dashboards, which are modeled on the corresponding Healthwatch dashboards but have additional options. For example, you can examine multiple foundations from one dashboard.
3. Explore one or two dashboards. [Examine Data with Dashboards and Charts](ui_examine_data.html) has an overview and includes a video.
4. As appropriate, clone any of the existing dashboards to add charts, modify queries, and more. See [Create, Customize, and Optimize Dashboards](ui_dashboards.html) and [Create and Customize Charts](ui_charts.html).

### Step 5 (Optional): Use the Service Broker to Send Custom Application Metrics to the Wavefront Proxy

1. In Ops Manager, in the **Wavefront Proxy Config** panel, select the **Enable Service Broker Bindings** check box.
2. To provision a Wavefront proxy service instance, run the command:

   ```
   cf create-service wavefront-proxy standard SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME
   ```

3. To bind apps to the service instance, run the command:

   ```
   cf bind-service APP_NAME SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME
   ```

4. If you already have an existing app and want to update its service instance reference from the v3 broker,
   first unbind it with this command:
   ```
   cf unbind-service APP_NAME SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME
   ```

Note: For information about how apps can send metrics to the Wavefront proxy, see the [cloud-foundry-sampleapp](https://github.com/wavefrontHQ/cloud-foundry-sampleapp).

### Step 6 (Optional): Connect Multiple Proxy Instances to an IAAS Load Balancer

#### Set Up the Load Balancer in Your IAAS

If you use multiple Wavefront VMs, you will want to use your IAAS of choice to set up a load balancer. BOSH DNS does not provide load balancing, so increasing the VM count will result in one VM taking all the requests.

In-depth instructions on configuring load balancers in different IAASes is beyond the scope of this documentation. You can see a detailed example across two sections of the TAS for VMs documentation:

1. Initial setup of load balancers is required for
   [AWS](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/3-0/aws/prepare-env-manual.html) and
   [GCP](https://docs.pivotal.io/ops-manager/3-0/gcp/prepare-env-manual.html#loadbalancer),
   but not for Azure.
2. After the initial setup, you can use
   [this](https://docs.pivotal.io/application-service/3-0/operating/configure-lb.html)
   document for finalizing the configuration of the load balancers in all IAAS.

Replace the example names for the load balancers from the documentation with names that suit a Wavefront proxy.
You can ignore the portions of these docs that contain information about interactions with Ops Manager, because we will talk about that in the next section.
- For GCP, record the backend service name of your load balancer.
- For AWS, record the actual Elastic Load Balancer name.
- For Azure, record the Azure Load Balancer name.

#### Configure the Tile to Use the Load Balancer for the Wavefront Proxy
1. Click the **Resource Configuration** tab for the tas2to tile in your Ops Manager configuration.
2. In the left column, click **Wavefront Proxy Configuration**.
3. Enter `http:${load_balancer_name}`,
   where `load_balancer_name` is the load balancer or backend service name from the initial setup.
4. Apply the changes to the tile and wait until the process completes.

#### Configure the Tile's Telegraf Instance to Send Traffic to the Load Balancer
By default, the Telegraf instance inside the tile will still use BOSH DNS. If you want the Telegraf requests to the Wavefront proxy to go through the load balancer, you must configure this.

1. Click the **Telegraf Agent Config** tab for the tile.
2. Under **Advanced Options**, click **Yes**.
3. In the **Custom Proxy URL** and **Custom Proxy Port** fields,
   enter the URL and port number for your load balancer.
4. Apply the changes to the tile.
