[VMware Tanzu Application Service]() previously known as Pivotal Cloud Foundry, is a popular platform for building cloud-native applications. This doc page explains:
* How to install and configure the Tanzu Observability by Wavefront nozzle from Tanzu Ops Manager.
* How to access the Tanzu Application Service integration, and what you can do there.

{% include important.html content="This document is for the Tanzu Application Service nozzle version 4.0 and later. Earlier versions are [documented here](https://docs.pivotal.io/wavefront-nozzle/3-x/). " %}

## Overview

Tanzu Observability by Wavefront (Wavefront) is a cloud-hosted service for full-featured observability. After you've set up Tanzu Application Service to send data to Wavefront, you can take advantage of preconfigured dashboards, customize predefined alerts, and more. You can clone and customize the predefined dashboards using the powerful Wavefront Query Language and selecting from many display options.

The VMware Tanzu Observability by Wavefront Nozzle includes the following key features:
* Send metrics from your VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (TAS for VMs) deployment to Wavefront.
* Bind Wavefront to any app running on VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (TAS for VMs).

Here's an overview of the flow of data from the Tanzu Application Service Firehose through the nozzle to the Wavefront service.

## Use Tanzu Application Service Dashboards and Alerts



After you've completed the Nozzle setup, your data become available in your Wavefront instance inside an integration. Each integration includes several tabs.
* The **Dashboards** tab includes a rich set of preconfigured dashboards with charts for [examining your data](ui_examine_data.html). Users with Dashboards permission can clone any dashboard and [customize the dashboard](ui_dashboards.html) and the charts. Watch our [dashboard videos](videos_dashboards_charts.html) for some tips and tricks.
* The **Alerts** tab includes a set of preconfigured alerts. Clone any alert and specify who to notify in your environment. Wavefront supports several levels of severity and allows you to specify email, Pagerduty, and Webhook as notification targets. Watch our [alerts videos](videos_alerts.html) to get you started.
* Get started with some of our [conceptual videos](videos_quickstart.html) or some of our [hands-on videos](videos_howto_start.html).
