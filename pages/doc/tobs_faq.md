## Why Can't I Edit This Dashboard? This Alert?

By default, all users can view dashboards and alerts. They can also edit dashboards and alerts but cannot save their changes. To do more, you need permissions.

<p><span style="font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: 600">Action</span></p>

1. Check your permissions. See [Examine Groups, Roles, and Permissions in Operations for Applications](users_account_managing.html#examine-groups-roles-and-permissions).
2. If you don't have the permissions you need, ask a user with the proper administration permissions or to grant you the permissions.
3. If that doesn't solve the problem, the individual dashboard or alert you're trying to edit might be protected by access control. The creator of the alert or dashboard or a Super Admin user can grant access.

## Why Is Our PPS So High? Why Do We Have Overage?

PPS and Overage determine what a customer is billed:
* **PPS** -- Or Points per Second, means data points ingested per second to the service. All customers are billed based on their PPS.
* **Overage** -- Many of our customers have a contract that specifies a certain PPS for a certain amount of time. If the customer exceeds that PPS, the customer is billed for overage.

Because the service runs on AWS, we have to bill based on how much data is ingested. However, we're interested in helping you lower your bill and get more out of VMware Aria Operations for Applications. We encourage you to find out:
* Are there dashboards or alerts that ingest data but that are never used?
* Are your queries looking at too much data, that is, could you filter as part of the query?

Start with [Improve PPS Usage and Prevent Overage](wavefront_usage_info.html) and learn how to examine your data and how to improve PPS.


## Why Is VMware Aria Operations for Applications So Slow?

VMware Aria Operations for Applications can handle a lot of data, but sometimes you need it faster!

<p><span style="font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: 600">Action</span></p>

* **Improve Rendering Speed**: You can make some modifications to slow dashboards to improve rendering speed. See [Ensure Optimal Dashboard Performance](ui_dashboards.html#ensure-optimal-dashboard-performance). Changes include ensuring that sampling is turned on, controlling that only events you need to see are displayed, and more.

* **Improve Data Shape and Cardinality**: At the heart of improving rendering speed and query execution speed is the shape of your data. If your dashboard or your query look at only the data you're actually interested in, performance improves drastically. See [Optimizing Data Shape to Improve Performance](optimize_data_shape.html) and [Find Ingestion and Query Problems](monitoring_overview.html).

## Do You Have Other FAQs?

Yes! We have FAQs for several areas of the product.
* [Alerts FAQ](alerts_faq.html) has answers about alerts firing (or not firing), tips for optimizing alerts, and more.
