## Do You Have Tutorials?

Yes!
* The [Integrations](hello_wavefront_aws_tutorial.html) tutorial has:
  - Detailed step-by-step instructions for ingesting data from AWS
  - A video about ingesting data from a Windows machine
  - Links to next steps
* The [Explore Data Tutorial](tutorial_dashboards.html) gives step-by-step instructions for exploring a sample dashboard. You don't need special permissions follow these steps.
* The [Query Language Tutorial](query_language_getting_started.html) explores the anatomy of a query, includes a few videos, and includes hands-on practice.
* The [Alerts Browser Tutorial](alerts.html#alerts-browser-tutorial) and the [Create Alerts Tutorial](alerts_manage.html#create-alert-tutorial) get you started with alerts.

## Do You Have Videos?

Yes! We have [a channel on VMware TV](https://vmwaretv.vmware.com/channel/Tanzu%2BObservability/252649793) that includes playlists for getting started, query language, alerting, and more.

## What Are the Differences Between New and Original Subscriptions?

Starting June 1-st, 2023, all **new** Operations for Applications subscriptions are onboarded to the [VMware Cloud services platform](https://console.cloud.vmware.com/). VMware Cloud services provides single sign-on (SSO) and identity access management (IAM) to your entire VMware Cloud services portfolio across hybrid and native public clouds, including Operations for Applications. Therefore, there are differences in the experience for **new** and **original** subscribers. 

### General UI Differences

* Permissions such as **Accounts**, **SAML IdP Admin**, and **API token** don't exist for **new** Operations for Applications subscriptions that are onboarded to VMware Cloud services, because all of the administration tasks requiring these permissions are done by using the VMware Cloud Services Console. For information about the basics for administering your Operations for Applications service running on the VMware Cloud services platform, see [Getting Started with Operations for Applications on VMware Cloud Services](csp_getting_started.html).

* When you customize your own account settings in the Operations for Applications UI, new subscribers do not see the **Groups, Roles&Permissions** and the **API Access** tabs (1) and can no longer change their password from the Operations for Applications UI (2), because this is done from the VMware Cloud Services Console.

  ![An image showing that the tabs mentioned above and the change password link are removed from the UI for new subscribers.](images/new-vs-original.png)

* The gear icon menu also differs, because many of the tasks for **new** subscribers are done by using the VMware Cloud Services Console. 

  For example, for Super Admins with Super Admin mode enabled, the gear icon menu looks like this:
 
  ![An image showing the differences in the gear icon menu, which are listed below.](images/new-vs-original-menu.png)

   * The **Self Service SAML** option is missing, because the configuration happens in the VMware Cloud Services Console.
   * The **Accounts** option is also no longer needed, because account management is done in the VMware Cloud Services Console.
   * The **Usage and Subscriptions** and **Ingestion Policies** menu items are combined in the **Usage and Subscriptions** menu item. 
   * The **Super Admin** menu item is missing, because Super Admins can invite new Super Admin users by using the VMware Cloud Services Console. 
   * There is a new **Orphaned Objects** menu item that allows Super Admins to see and recover orphan dashboards or alerts.
   * The **Sign Out** menu item is missing, because signing out of Operations for Applications is done from the VMware Cloud Services Console.

* Users with the **Accounts** permission still can set the default settings for new users and modify access to new dashboards and alerts from the **Organization Settings** page, but some of the options are removed:

   * The options for adding default groups for new user and service accounts, as well as for setting the default permissions for new user accounts are removed, because these operations are done through the VMware Cloud Services Console.

     ![An image showing that the options mentioned above are removed from the UI for new subscribers.](images/new-vs-original-new-accounts-defaults.png)

  * The option for granting access to new dashboards and alerts to service accounts is removed. You grant access to  objects when you create a `Server to server app` and define its scope in the VMware Cloud Services Console. Scopes provide a way to implement control over what areas in an Organization your client can access - specifically which role in an Organization, and what services and the level of permissions.

     ![An image showing that the option to grant access to service accounts is removed from the UI for new subscribers.](images/new-vs-original-org-settings-security.png)

* Metrics Security 

    ![An image showing the differences for metrics security rules in the UI .](images/new-vs-original-metrics-security.png)

## Why Can't I Edit This Dashboard? This Alert?

By default, all users can view dashboards and alerts. They can also edit dashboards and alerts but cannot save their changes. To do more, you need permissions.

<p><span style="font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: 600">Action</span></p>

1. Check your permissions. See [Examine Groups, Roles, and Permissions](users_account_managing.html#examine-groups-roles-and-permissions).
2. If you don't have the permissions you need, ask a user with the **Accounts** permission to grant you the permissions.
3. If that doesn't solve the problem, the individual dashboard or alert you're trying to edit might be protected by [access control](access.html). The creator of the alert or dashboard or a Super Admin user can grant access.

## Why Is Our PPS So High? Why Do We Have Overage?

PPS and Overage determine what a customer is billed:
* **PPS** -- Or Points per Second, means data points ingested per second to the service. All customers are billed based on their PPS.
* **Overage** -- Many of our customers have a contract that specifies a certain PPS for a certain amount of time. If the customer exceeds that PPS, the customer is billed for overage.

Because the service runs on AWS, we have to bill based on how much data is ingested. However, we're interested in helping you lower your bill and get more out of VMware Aria Operations for Applications. We encourage you to find out:
* Are there dashboards or alerts that ingest data but that are never used?
* Are your queries looking at too much data, that is, could you filter as part of the query?

Start with [Improve PPS Usage and Prevent Overage](wavefront_usage_info.html) and learn how to examine your data and how to improve PPS.


## Why Is VMware Aria Operations for Applications So Slow?

VMware Aria Operations for Applications can handle a lot of data, but sometimes you need it faster!

<p><span style="font-size: 1.1em; font-weight: 600">Action</span></p>

* **Improve Rendering Speed**: You can make some modifications to slow dashboards to improve rendering speed. See [Ensure Optimal Dashboard Performance](ui_dashboards.html#ensure-optimal-dashboard-performance). Changes include ensuring that sampling is turned on, controlling that only events you need to see are displayed, and more.

* **Improve Data Shape and Cardinality**: At the heart of improving rendering speed and query execution speed is the shape of your data. If your dashboard or your query look at only the data you're actually interested in, performance improves drastically. See [Optimizing Data Shape to Improve Performance](optimize_data_shape.html) and [Find Ingestion and Query Problems](monitoring_overview.html).

## Do You Have Other FAQs?

Yes! We have FAQs for several areas of the product.
* [Alerts FAQ](alerts_faq.html) has answers about alerts firing (or not firing), tips for optimizing alerts, and more.
* [Kubernetes FAQ](wavefront_kubernetes_faq.html) has answers to questions about filtering data, monitoring Prometheus endpoints, and more.
* [Tracing FAQ](tracing_faq.html) is for users of our tracing offering.
* [Authorization FAQ](authorization-faq.html) helps administrators who want the important authorization questions answered.
