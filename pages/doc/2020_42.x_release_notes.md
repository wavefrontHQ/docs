<td width="60%">The <a href="https://www.apdex.org/overview.html">apdex score</a> helps you understand how the response time of a service compares to the predefined response time threshold (T). Using Wavefront, you can:
<ul>
<li>Get an overview of how the apdex score is calculated and <a href="tracing_apdex.html">Configure Apdex Settings</a>.</li>
<li>Use <a href="hs_apdex_function.html">apdex() function</a> to customize the apdex score for your services, create charts, and create alerts.</li>
<li>Use <a href="hs_apdex_latency_function.html">apdexLatency() function</a> to customize the satisfied threshold (T) and toleration threshold (4T) of a service.</li>
</ul>

## New Dashboard for Usage Monitoring

Tanzu Observability by Wavefront automatically tracks the number of metrics received for the first 3 levels of your **metric namespace** as [delta counters](https://docs.wavefront.com/delta_counters.html), which can be queried with `cs(~metric.global.namespace.*)`. The `.` character separates the levels. For example for a metric named `disk.space.total.bytes`, the first level is `disk`, the second is `space`, and the third is `total`.

A new Metric Namespace Breakdown dashboard in the Wavefront Usage integration helps you explore the trend of your metrics ingestion rate using those delta counters.

* The pie chart displays the largest contributors to your rate across all first-level metrics.
* The **View Under 2nd Level** and **View Under 3rd Level** variables control which data will be displayed in the **Second Level** and **Third Level** charts.

You can also view the breakdown of histograms, spans and delta counters themselves under **~histogram.global.namespace.***, **~span.global.namespace.***, and **~counter.global.namespace.***
