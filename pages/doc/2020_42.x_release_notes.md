These release notes give an overview of the changes for Release 2020-42.x of the Wavefront service.


## Apdex Score for Services

Wavefront Distributed Tracing now includes Apdex.

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="60%">The <a href="https://www.apdex.org">apdex score</a> helps you understand how the response time of a service compares to the predefined response time threshold (T). Using Wavefront, you can:
<ul>
<li>Get an overview of how the Apdex score is calculated and <a href="tracing_apdex.html">Configure Apdex Settings</a>.</li>
<li>Use <a href="hs_apdex_function.html">apdex() function</a> to customize the Apdex score for your services, create charts, and create alerts.</li>
<li>Use <a href="hs_apdex_latency_function.html">apdexLatency() function</a> to customize the satisfied threshold (T) and toleration threshold (4T) of a service.</li>
</ul>
</td>

## AWS and Database Services in Application Map

The application map that's part of Distributed Tracing now displays AWS and database services using distinct icons.

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="40%">Wavefront can identify out-of-the-box Java AWS services and Java databases in the application map view.<br/><br/> <a href="tracing_external_services.html#configure-out-of-the-box-aws-and-database-services">Configure Out-of-the-Box AWS and Database Services</a> explains how to configure your OpenTracing, OpenTelemetry, or Spring Cloud Sleuth application to identify out-of-the-box external services or applications that your service communicates with.
</td>
<td width="60%"><img src="images/tracing_key_concepts_external_nodes.png" alt="Application map view with two external AWS services and database service."/></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


## Custom External Services in Application Map

In the application map that's part of Distributed Tracing, you can now configure external services such as Redis or Ngnix to show up with a custom icon.

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="40%">In addition to the out-of-the-box Java AWS and database service, Wavefront can identify your external applications or services. <br/> <br/>See <a href="tracing_external_services.html#configure-custom-external-services">Configure Custom External Services</a>
</td>
<td width="60%"><img src="images/tracing_custom_external_services_final.png" alt="Application map with the custom Redis database, Nginx load balancer, and an out-of-the-box Amazon SNS service."/></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


## New Dashboards for Usage Monitoring

We've added 2 new dashboards to the Wavefront Usage integration.

### Wavefront Namespace Usage Explorer

Tanzu Observability by Wavefront automatically tracks the number of metrics received for the first 3 levels of your **metric namespace** as [delta counters](https://docs.wavefront.com/delta_counters.html), which can be queried with `cs(~metric.global.namespace.*)`. The `.` character separates the levels. For example for a metric named `disk.space.total.bytes`, the first level is `disk`, the second is `space`, and the third is `total`.

The Wavefront Metrics  Breakdown dashboard helps you explore the trend of your metrics ingestion rate using those delta counters.

* The pie chart displays the largest contributors to your rate across all first-level metrics.
* The **View Under 2nd Level** and **View Under 3rd Level** variables control which data will be displayed in the **Second Level** and **Third Level** charts.

If your environment uses histograms, spans, or delta counters you can view the breakdown of those data under **~histogram.global.namespace.&#42;**, **~span.global.namespace.&#42;**, and **~counter.global.namespace.&#42;**

### Committed Rate and Monthy Usage (PPS P95) Dashboard

This dashboard helps you avoid exceeding the committed rate for your instance by exploring dashboards and creating alerts. The charts in the dashboard have a focus on showing where usage exceeds 95% of the committed rate.

## Miscellaneous Improvements


* The derived metrics feature now supports both time series metrics and histograms.
* The [filter() function](ts_filter.html) now supports the use of source tag filters.
* You can now Zoom into a region of a histogram chart.

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="50%">1. Select a region to zoom in. <br/>

<td width="50%">2. Click <strong>Reset</strong> to return to the default.<br/>

## Doc Updates

* New [Tracing Tutorial](/tracing_java_tutorial.html) (Java).
* Video about [Browsing Your Data](https://vmwaretv.vmware.com/media/t/1_ubikydhv) from the Metrics Browser or the Source Browser.
* Video about [Cumulative Counters and Delta Counters](https://vmwaretv.vmware.com/media/t/1_khsugqea)
