These release notes give an overview of the changes for Release 2020-42.x of the Wavefront service.


## Apdex Score for Services

The [apdex score](https://www.apdex.org/overview.html) helps you understand how the response time of a service compares to the predefined response time threshold (T). Using Wavefront, you can:

* Get an overview of how the apdex score is calculated and [Configure Apdex Settings](tracing_apdex.html).
* Use [`apdex()`](apdex-function.html) to query the apdex score for your services, create charts, and create alerts.
* Use [`apdexLatency()`](apdex-function.htmll#apdexlatency-functions) to query the satisfied threshold (T) and toleration threshold (4T) of a service.

## AWS and Database Services in Application Map

Wavefront can identify out-of-the-box Java AWS services and Java databases in the application map view. See [Configure Out-of-the-Box AWS and Database Services](tracing_external_services.html#configure-out-of-the-box-aws-and-database-services) for details on configuring your OpenTracing, OpenTelemetry, or Spring Cloud Sleuth application to identify out-of-the-box external services or applications that your service communicates.

## Custom External Services in Application Map

In addition to the out-of-the-box Java AWS and database service, Wavefront can identify your external applications or services. See [Configure Custom External Services](tracing_external_services.html#configure-custom-external-services).

## New Dashboard for Usage Monitoring

Tanzu Observability by Wavefront automatically tracks the number of metrics received for the first 3 levels of your **metric namespace** as [delta counters](https://docs.wavefront.com/delta_counters.html), which can be queried with `cs(~metric.global.namespace.*)`. The `.` character separates the levels. For example for a metric named `disk.space.total.bytes`, the first level is `disk`, the second is `space`, and the third is `total`.

A new Metric Namespace Breakdown dashboard in the Wavefront Usage integration helps you explore the trend of your metrics ingestion rate using those delta counters.

* The pie chart displays the largest contributors to your rate across all first-level metrics.
* The **View Under 2nd Level** and **View Under 3rd Level** variables control which data will be displayed in the **Second Level** and **Third Level** charts.

You can also view the breakdown of histograms, spans and delta counters themselves under **~histogram.global.namespace.***, **~span.global.namespace.***, and **~counter.global.namespace.***

## Miscellaneous Improvements

The derived metrics feature now supports both time series metrics and histograms.
