## Azure Integration
* Starting with this release, metrics in Azure integrations are more complete. Wavefront integrations receive certain metrics from Azure with a lag, and this release takes the lag into account.

## Distributed Tracing (Beta) Enhancements

### Traces Browser and Service Map
* The [Traces browser](tracing_traces_browser.html) supports a streamlined task flow for examining traces. You can perform trace queries, view query results, expand traces to see their member spans, and expand individual spans to see their details, without having to navigate between pages and pop-ups.

* The [service map](tracing_traces_browser.html#investigate-the-service-map-for-a-trace) in the Traces browser shows the services involved in a trace. The service map lets you examine:
  - Service dependencies
  - Flow of request calls between the services
  - Health of the service (RED metrics) without navigating to another page

### Trace Queries

* [Query Builder](trace_data_query.html) in the Traces browser now lets you to filter on the minimum or maximum duration of entire traces.

* You can use the new [`traces()`](traces_function.html) function to perform trace queries in Query Editor. You can use the [`spans()`](spans_function.html) function with the REST API to obtain a JSON list of matching spans.

### Wavefront OpenCensus Go Exporter

* You can now use the [Wavefront OpenCensus Go Exporter](https://opencensus.io/exporters/supported-exporters/go/wavefront/) to push metrics, histograms, and traces into Wavefront from a Go application that is intrumented with OpenCensus.

### Trace RED Metrics

* You can now query for [trace RED metrics](trace_data_details.html#span-red-metrics-and-trace-red-metrics), and visualize the results in your own charts, just as you would do for any other metrics in Wavefront. You can create alerts on trace data by using RED metrics queries in alert conditions.
* Trace RED metrics are derived from each trace’s root span and end span. Trace RED metrics are useful for measuring the durations of traces that have asynchronous spans, especially when a child span extends beyond the root span.
