summary: Learn how to send AWS Metrics data to Wavefront.
---
Amazon Web Services (AWS), is a collection of cloud-computing services that provide an on-demand computing platform. The Wavefronts Amazon Web Services integration allows you to ingest metrics directly from AWS. The Wavefront Amazon Web Services built-in integration is part of the setup, but the additional steps in this document are needed to complete and customize integration setup.

{% include shared/badge.html content="You must have [Proxy Management permission](permissions_overview.html) to set up an AWS integration. If you do not have permission, the UI menu selections, buttons, and links you use to perform the tasks are not visible." %}

## Supported AWS Integrations

The AWS integration ingests data from the following products:

- **[CloudWatch](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch)** - retrieves AWS [metric and
dimension](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CW_Support_For_AWS.html) data.
- **[CloudTrail](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail)** - retrieves EC2 event information and creates Wavefront System events that represent the AWS events.
- **[AWS Metrics+](integrations_aws_metrics.html#aws-metrics-data)** - retrieves additional metrics using AWS APIs other than CloudWatch. Data include EBS volume data and  EC2 instance metadata like tags. You can investigate billing data  and the number of reserved instances. Be sure to enable AWS+ metrics because it allows Wavefront to optimize its use of Cloudwatch, and saves money on Cloudwatch calls as a result.

For information how to monitor AWS data ingestion, see [AWS Integration](wavefront_monitoring.html#aws-integration).

## AWS Account ID and External ID

Adding an AWS integration requires establishing a trust relationship between Amazon and Wavefront by sharing account IDs and an external ID. The external ID is generated by Wavefront and is then used for all types of data: CloudWatch, CloudTrail, AWS Metrics, etc. at once.

## Managing an AWS Integration

From the page of the integration you select, you can add an AWS integration, enable and disable it, and delete an AWS integration.

### Adding an AWS Integration

1. In Wavefront, click **Integrations** in the task bar.
1. In the Featured section, click the **Amazon Web Services** tile.
1. Click the **Setup** tab.
1. Click **Set Up Amazon Integration**.
1. Follow the instructions in the right panel to give Wavefront read-only access to your Amazon account.
1.  Configure the integration properties:
     - **Name** - Name to identify the integration.
     - **Role ARN** - Role ARN from Amazon account.
     - **Bucket Name -** The S3 bucket containing CloudTrail logs. In your AWS account, go to **CloudTrail** &gt;**Trails** to see the bucket name.
     - **Prefix** - A log file prefix specified when you created the CloudTrail.
     - **CloudTrail Region** - AWS Region where the CloudTrail logs reside.
1.  Click **SET UP**. The integration is added to the Amazon Web Services Integrations list. If you want to configure whitelists and refresh rate for the CloudWatch integration, click the **CloudWatch** link in the Types column and follow the instructions in [Configuring CloudWatch Data Ingestion](#configure).

### Enabling and Disabling AWS Integrations

Wavefront automatically disables integrations that are experiencing errors due to invalid credentials. To enable an integration after the credential has been corrected or to manually disable an integration:

1. In Wavefront, click **Integrations** in the task bar.
1. In the Featured section, click the **Amazon Web Services** tile.
1. Click the **Setup** tab.
1. Click the **Advanced** link.
1. In the row that contains the integration that you want to enable or disable, click the three dots and select **Enable** or **Disable**.

### Deleting AWS Integrations

To delete one or more integrations:

- Select the checkboxes next to one or more integrations and click <i class="fa-trash fa"/>.
- In the row containing the integration you want to delete, click the three dots, select **Delete** and confirm.


## Giving Wavefront Global Read-Only Access

         - **Prefix** - A log file prefix specified when you created the CloudTrail.
     - **CloudWatch**
         - Whitelists and Service Refresh Rate - see <a href="#configure">Configuring CloudWatch Data Ingestion</a>.
1.  Click **Save**. The selected integration(s) are created and added to the Cloud Integrations list.

## Giving Wavefront Limited Access

Instead of giving Wavefront read-only access, you can instead give more limited access. The permissions we require depend on the integration, as shown in the following table:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th scope="col">Integration</th>
    <th scope="col">Description</th>
    <th scope="col">Required Permissions </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>CloudWatch</td>
    <td>Retrieves AWS metric and dimension data </td>
    <td><p>ListMetrics<br />
      GetMetricStatistics</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>CloudTrail <br /></td>
    <td>Retrieves EC2 event information and creates Wavefront System events </td>
    <td><p>List and Get permissions on the S3 bucket where the logs are delivered.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>AWS Metrics+ </td>
    <td>Retrieves additional metrics using AWS APIs </td>
    <td>DescribeVolumes<br />
      DescribeInstances<br />
    DescribeReservedInstances</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The following basic JSON snippet shows how to add IAM permissions to AWS integrations:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "cloudwatch:GetMetricStatistics",
                "cloudwatch:ListMetrics",
                "ec2:Describe*",
                "s3:Get*",
                "s3:List*"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## CloudWatch Data

Wavefront retrieves AWS metric and dimension data from AWS services using the AWS CloudWatch API. The complete list of metrics and dimensions that can be retrieved from AWS CloudWatch is available at [Amazon CloudWatch Metrics and Dimensions Reference](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CW_Support_For_AWS.html). In addition, you can publish [custom AWS metrics](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html) that can also be ingested by the CloudWatch integration.

<a name="configure"></a>

### Configuring CloudWatch Data Ingestion

You can configure which instances and volumes to ingest metrics from, which metrics to ingest, and the rate at which Wavefront fetches metrics. To configure CloudWatch ingestion:

1. In Wavefront, click **Integrations** in the task bar.
1. In the Featured section, click the **Amazon Web Services** tile.
1. Click the **Setup** tab.
1. In the Types column, click the **CloudWatch** link in the row of the integration you want to configure.
1. Configure ingestion properties:
    - **Instance and Volume Whitelist** fields - Whitelist instances and volumes by specifying [EC2 tags](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html) (as **&lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;** pairs) defined on the instances and volumes. For example, **organization=&lt;yourcompany&gt;**. When specified as a comma-separated list, the tags are OR'd. To use instance and volume whitelisting, you must also add an [AWS Metrics+](#aws-metrics-plus-integration) integration because the AWS tags are imported from the EC2 service. If you don't specify any tags, Wavefront imports metrics from *all* instances and volumes.
    - **Metric Whitelist** field - Whitelist metrics by specifying a regular expression. The regular expression must be a complete match of the entire metric name. For example, if you only want CloudWatch data for `elb` and `rds` (which come under `aws.rds`), then use a regular expression such as: `^aws.(elb|rds).*$`. If you do not specify a regular expression, _all_ CloudWatch metrics are retrieved.
    - **Point Tag Whitelist** - Whitelist AWS point tags by specifying a regular expression. If you do not specify a regular expression, no point tags are added to metrics.
    - **Service Refresh Rate** - Number of minutes between requesting metrics. Default: 5.
1. Click **Save**.

### Sources

Wavefront automatically sets each metric's source field and adds source tags to each AWS source, as follows:

**Metric Source Field**

Wavefront sets the value of the AWS metric [`source`](wavefront_data_format.html) field by service:

- **EC2** - the value of the **hostname**, **host**, or **name** [EC2 tags](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html), if the tags exist and you have an EC2 integration. Otherwise, the source is set to the Amazon instance ID.
- **EBS** - the Amazon instance ID of the EC2 instance the volume is attached to.
- All other services - the value of the *first* CloudWatch dimension. The supported dimensions appear at the bottom of the Amazon service metric documentation topic. For example, see [Amazon EC2 Dimensions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ec2-metricscollected.html#ec2-metric-dimensions).

**Source Tags**

AWS sources are assigned source tags that identify their originating service following this pattern: `~integration.aws.<service>`, for example, `~integration.aws.ec2`.

### Point Tags

Wavefront adds the following point tags to CloudWatch metrics:

- `accountId` - the Amazon account that reported the metric.
- `Region` - The region in which the service is running. Added to EC2 and EBS metrics only.
- CloudWatch dimensions. The dimensions vary by service. For example, for AWS S3, the `BucketName` dimension is added as a point tag.

### CloudWatch Pricing

Standard AWS CloudWatch pricing applies each time Wavefront requests metrics using the CloudWatch API. For pricing information, see [AWS \| Amazon CloudWatch \| Pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing). After selecting a region, you can find the current expected price under **Amazon CloudWatch API Requests**. In addition, custom metrics have a premium price; see the **Amazon CloudWatch Custom Metrics** section of the pricing page. To limit cost, by default Wavefront queries the API every 5 minutes. However, you can [change the request rate](#configuring-cloudwatch-metric-ingestion), which will change the cost.

As an alternative to using the CloudWatch API for EC2 metrics, you can collect these metrics using [a Telegraf collector](telegraf.html) on each AWS instance. In this case, to prevent CloudWatch from requesting those metrics, you should set the **Metric Whitelist** property to allow all metrics except EC2. For example:

```
^aws.(billing|instance|sqs|sns|reservedInstance|ebs|route53.health|ec2.status|elb|s3).*$
```

By default, on a new Wavefront trial, Wavefront limits the number of unique metrics that can be retrieved from CloudWatch to 10K to cap the AWS CloudWatch bill.

### Configuring Billing Metrics

The AWS Billing and Cost Management service sends [billing metrics](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/billing-metricscollected.html) to CloudWatch. You configure AWS to produce `aws.billing.*` metrics by checking the **Receive Billing Alerts** checkbox on the **Preferences** tab in the [AWS Billing and Cost Management console](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/monitor-charges.html):

![aws billing](images/aws_billing.png)

Wavefront reports the single metric `aws.billing.estimatedcharges`. The `source` field and `ServiceName` point tag identify the AWS services. For the total estimated charge metric, `source` is set to `usd` and `ServiceName` is empty. Wavefront also provides the point tags `accountId`, `Currency`, `LinkedAccount`, and `Region`. Billing metrics are typically reported every 4 hours.

## CloudTrail Events, Metrics, and Point Tags

Wavefront retrieves CloudTrail event information stored in JSON-formatted log files in an S3 bucket. The CloudTrail integration parses the files for all events that result from an operation that is not a describe, get, or list, and creates a Wavefront [System event](events.html).

In the [Events browser](events.html) the events are named **AWS Action: \<Operation\>** and have the event tag `aws.cloudtrail.ec2`. For example:

![aws start instance](images/aws_start_instances.png)

Starting with release 2018.22.x, we group AWS CloudTrail events by the minute and report the metrics. We also support several point tags that allow you to filter the events.

### CloudTrail Metrics

Each metrics starts with `aws.cloudtrail.event.`, followed by one of the EC2 operation names.

The EC2 operations include:
- **\[Run\|Start\|Stop\|Terminate\|Monitor\|Unmonitor\]Instances**
- **\[Attach\|Detach\]Volume**
- **DeleteNetworkInterface**
- **AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress**
- **CreateSecurityGroup**
- **RequestSpotInstances**
- **CancelSpotInstanceRequests**
- **ModifyInstanceAttribute**
- **CreateTags**
- **\[Create\|Delete\]KeyPair**
- **DeregisterImage**

As a result, the metrics include, for example `aws.cloudtrail.event.Start` or `aws.cloudtrail.event.CreateTags`.

In addition, the metric `aws.cloudtrail.event.total-per-minute` reports the per-minute count of *all* AWS API calls recorded by the AWS CloudTrail integration.

### Point Tags for Filtering CloudTrail Metrics
You can use the following point tags to filter the metrics.

<table>
<tbody>
<thead>
<tr><th width="30%">Point tag</th><th width="50%">Description</th><th width="20%">Example</th></tr>
</thead>
<tr>
<td>eventType</td>
<td>The type of event that generated the event record.
</td>
<td>AwsApiCall, AwsServiceEvent </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>eventSource</td>
<td>The service that the request was made to.</td>
<td>ec2.amazonaws.com</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Region</td>
<td>The AWS region that the request was made to.
</td>
<td>us-east-2</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>accountId</td>
<td>The account ID that you specified when you set up the AWS CloudTrail integration.
</td>
<td>User42</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>bucket</td>
<td>Bucket that you specified when you set up the AWS CloudTrail integration.
</td>
<td>A random number</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## AWS Metrics+ Data

AWS Metrics+ are metrics retrieved using AWS metrics API calls other than CloudWatch.
Unless otherwise indicated, Wavefront sets the value of the AWS Metrics+ `source` field to the AWS instance ID. If an EBS volume is detached, its source field is set to the volume ID. The metrics include:

- `aws.instance.price` - EC2 instances and how much they cost per hour. This metric includes the point tags `availabilityZone`, `instanceID`, `instanceLifecycle`, `instanceType`, and `operatingSystem`.
- `aws.reservedinstance.count` - Number of reserved instances in each availability zone by each instance type. This metric includes the point tags `availabilityZone`, `instanceID`, `instanceType`, and `operatingSystem`. This metric appears only if your account has reserved instances.
- EBS metrics - EBS metrics include the point tags `instanceID`, `Region`, `State`, `Status`, `volumeId`, and `volumeType` (see [Amazon EBS Volume Types](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html)). The `Status` can be `attached`, `detaching`, or `attaching`. The `State` can be `available` (detached) or `in-use` (attached).
  - `aws.ebs.volumesize` - The volume size of the elastic block store.
  - `aws.ebs.volumeiops` - The volume I/O operations of the elastic block store.
- SQS - [AWS SQS](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/sqs-metricscollected.html) metrics retrieved every minute from the SQS service.
  - `aws.sqs.approximatenumberofmessagesnotvisible` - The number of messages that are "in flight." Messages are considered in flight if they have been sent to a client but have not yet been deleted or have not yet reached the end of their visibility window.
  - `aws.sqs.approximatenumberofmessagesdelayed` - The number of messages in the queue that are delayed and not available for reading immediately. This can happen when the queue is configured as a delay queue or when a message has been sent with a delay parameter.
  - `aws.sqs.approximatenumberofmessages` aliased to the CloudWatch metric `aws.sqs.approximatenumberofmessagesvisible` - The number of messages available for retrieval from the queue.
- Pricing Metrics - capture the current pricing of EC2 instances. These metrics are available as a preview and subject to change. These metrics have the point tags  `instanceType`, `operatingSystem`, `Region`, `purchaseOption` (All Upfront, Partial Upfront, No Upfront), `leaseContractLength` (1 or 3 years), and `offeringClass` (standard or convertible)). The `source` field is set to the display name of the region. For example, if `Region=us-west2`, then `source=us west (oregon)`.
  - `~sample.aws.ec2.on-demand.price.hourly` - the hourly price (in US$) of an on-demand instance.
  - `~sample.aws.ec2.reserved.price.upfront` - the up-front payment (in US$) for a reservation.  This metric reports `0` when `purchaseOption` is No Upfront.
  - `~sample.aws.ec2.reserved.price.hourly` - the hourly payment (in US$) for a reservation. This metric reports `0` when the `purchaseOption` is All Upfront.

## Viewing AWS Metrics

You can view AWS metrics by selecting **Browse &gt; Metrics** and searching for metrics beginning with `aws.`:

![aws metrics](images/aws_metrics.png)

You can drill into the folder for a specific service and click a metric to navigate to a chart that displays that set of data. For example, clicking clicking the folder `aws.ec2.`, then the metric `aws.ec2.cpuutilization`, and then refining the query by the `Region` point tag and the `topk` function yields the following chart:

![aws cpu utilization](images/aws_cpu_utilization.png)

### AWS Aggregate Metrics

All AWS metrics return the following aggregate metrics: average, maximum, minimum, sample count, and sum. To view the aggregate metrics,

1.  Search for a specific metric, for example `aws.ec2.cpuutilization`:

    ![aws cpu utilization folder](images/aws_cpu_utilization_metric.png)

2.  Click the metric folder, for example `aws.ec2.cpuutilization.`, to display the aggregate metrics:

    ![aws cpu utilization aggregate metrics](images/aws_cpu_utilization_aggregate_metrics.png)

## AWS Dashboards

If you set up an [Amazon Web Services integration](integrations.html), Wavefront installs AWS overview dashboards Summary, Pricing, and Billing and the AWS service-specific dashboards: EC2, ECS, ELB, DynamoDB, Lambda, and Redshift. All AWS dashboards have a tag `~integration.aws.<service>`. For example: `~integration.aws.ec2`, `~integration.aws.lambda`, etc.
