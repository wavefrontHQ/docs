<td width="70%"><br><p>Wavefront gives observability into your cloud environment and packaged applications. To get data into Wavefront, use an integration with preconfigured dashboards or one of the Wavefront SDKs. Send data from several sources to a Wavefront proxy or use direct ingestion. Finally, add dashboards, charts, and alerts to monitor exactly what you need.</p> </td>

<p>Charts help you visualize data and find problems. Jason shows how to pick a chart type and how to configure a chart so it shows exactly what you need. For example, a stacked area chart shows the total requests from all environments but also each environment individually. You use query language functions to further customize what you see. </p>

<p markdown="span">Wavefront supports sophisticated alerts that go far beyond traditional alerting systems. Clement explains how alerts work using the example of a simple threshold alert. The alert fires when any monitored time series exceeds the threshold for 10 minutes. Wavefront then sends an alert notification to all specified alert targets. When the alert is resolved, notifications are sent to the targets again. Additional examples are shown in [other videos](videos_alerts.html).</p>

<p>Jason demos in the Wavefront UI how you can find firing alerts and look at alert details. He also shows how you can look at alert events in a chart window. </p>
