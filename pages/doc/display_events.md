summary: This topic describes how to display events in charts.

Icons associated with [events](events) can be displayed on the X-axis of a chart. If a single event occurs in a given time
interval,  the event icon displays as a dot. If two or more events occur in a given time interval, the event icon
displays as an asterisk <i class="fa fa-asterisk"></i>.  The color of an event icon is associated with the severity:

- SEVERE - <span style="color: #d9534f;">red</span>
- WARN - <span style="color: #FFA320;">orange</span>
- SMOKE - <span style="color: #B8C8D8;">gray</span>
- INFO - <span style="color: #00B3CA;">blue</span>

Instantaneous events display a vertical line that overlays the chart; non-instantaneous or ongoing events display a
shaded box representing the duration of the event.

You control event displays at the chart level (local) by adding events() queries to a chart. You can also control the
displays at the dashboard level (global). To control when event icons are displayed on every chart in a dashboard,
select **Show Events >**:

<dl>
<dt>In Chart Queries</dt><dd>Display events based on the selection at the individual chart level.</dd>
<dt>In Dashboard Prefs</dt><dd>Display the events defined by the global events() expression set in [dashboard preferences](https://community.wavefront.com/docs/DOC-1068#jive_content_id_Setting_Dashboard_Preferences).</dd>
<dt>In Chart & Dashboard</dt><dd>Display the set of events from chart events() and global events() expressions.</dd>
<dt>Related Alerts</dt><dd>Display events generated by an alert based on a single source or set of sources.</dd>
