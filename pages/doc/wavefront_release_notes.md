This page lists new and updated features for the Tanzu Observability by Wavefront service.

* For **Wavefront Proxy**, your go-to place is the [Wavefront proxy GitHub page](https://GitHub.com/wavefrontHQ/java/releases). On that page, you can see releases in progress and GA versions. If proxy changes are important for the service, we update this doc set, for example, with new configuration parameters, ports, etc.
* For the latest changes and releases of our **Integrations**, see the [Integrations Release Notes](integrations_new_changed.html).
* For **Observability for Kubernetes**, go to the [release notes for Wavefront Collector for Kubernetes GitHub repository](https://github.com/wavefrontHQ/wavefront-collector-for-kubernetes/releases).

## 2022-33.x Release Notes

We've made the following improvements to the Wavefront service:

* The **Usage Limit** chart on the [ingestion policy dashboard](ingestion_policies.html#examine-ingestion-policy-usage) now shows the P95 usage by the policy out of the PPS limit.
* **Integrations**: The August 2022 integrations release was made available! We made significant improvements to a number of integrations and also added the VMware Tanzu Greenplum integration. See the [Integration Release Notes](integrations_new_changed.html#august-2022) for details.

Concurrently with this release, we've just released [Wavefront Proxy 11.4](https://GitHub.com/wavefrontHQ/java/releases). 
- Added the following internal metrics for proxy logs:
	- `~proxy.logs.*.received.messageLength`: Size of log message fields before validation
	- `~proxy.logs.*.received.tagLength`: Size of label per log message
	- `~proxy.logs.*.received.batches`: Number of incoming batches of logs
- For preprocessor rules `extractTag` and `extractTagIfNotExists`, applied rule to tag key values when source is pointLine.
- Improved accuracy of exponential delta histograms at the lowest percentiles.
- Completed fix to block points with EOT characters.
- Fixed an issue where the span log sampling policy was not synced with the Wavefront server.
- Updated the dependency versions.
