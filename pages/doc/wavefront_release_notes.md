## Announcements

### VMware Aria Operations for Applications on VMware Cloud Services

Starting July 3, 2023, VMware Aria Operations for Applications is a service on the [VMware Cloud services platform](https://console.cloud.vmware.com/). After this date, we support two types of subscriptions: 

* **Onboarded Subscriptions**: Operations for Applications subscriptions that are onboarded to the VMware Cloud services platform. 
* **Original Subscriptions**: Existing subscriptions which remain as is until onboarded to VMware Cloud services. 
   
For information about the two subscription types and how they differ, see [Subscription Types](subscriptions-differences.html).
 
{% include note.html content="We will support both original and onboarded subscriptions until all original subscriptions are onboarded to VMware Cloud services."%}

### Free Trial of VMware Aria Operations for Applications on VMware Cloud Services

Starting September 20, 2023, all **new trial** instances of Operations for Applications are **onboarded** to VMware Cloud services. You can [start a free trial](start_trial.html) directly from the VMware Cloud Services Console.

### Onboarding Original VMware Aria Operations for Applications to VMware Cloud Services

In October, 2023, we start to incrementally [**onboard**](csp_migration.html) all original subscriptions to VMware Cloud services. You will receive a notification in your Operations for Applications UI with the date scheduled for your service onboarding to VMware Cloud services. Make sure that you get familiar with the VMware Cloud services platform and prepare for the onboarding. See [What Should I Do Before the Onboarding?](csp_migration.html#what-should-i-do-before-the-onboarding).

{% include warning.html content="The Operations for Applications authentication and authorization will be **deprecated** in the future. Therefore, after onboarding to VMware Cloud services, **replace** [your service accounts with server to server apps](csp_migration.html#how-to-replace-a-service-account-with-a-server-to-server-app) and [your Operations for Applications API tokens with VMware Cloud Services access tokens](csp_migration.html#how-to-replace-an-operations-for-applications-api-token-with-a-vmware-cloud-services-access-token), including [the Operations for Application API tokens of your Wavefront proxies](csp_migration.html#how-to-replace-the-operations-for-application-api-token-of-a-wavefront-proxy)." %}

## 2024-07.x Release Notes

**Ephemeral Internal Metrics**: Most of the [internal metrics](wavefront-internal-metrics.html) are now [ephemeral](metric_types.html#metric-types-per-retention-period) and not convertible to persistent. Exceptions are the following internal metrics, which remain persistent:

- `~collector.*points.reported`
- `~externalservices.*.points`
- `~derived-metrics.points.reported`
- `~collector.*histograms.reported`
- `~derived-histograms.histograms.reported`
- `~collector.*spans.reported`
- `~query.metrics_scanned`
- `~proxy.points.*.received`
- `~proxy.histograms.*.received`
- `~proxy.spans.*.received`
- `~proxy.spanLogs.*.received`
- `~proxy.build.version`
- `~metric.global.namespace.*`
- `~histogram.global.namespace.*`
- `~counter.global.namespace.*`



## 2024-05.x Release Notes

* **New Ephemeral Metric Type**: With this release, we introduce ephemeral metrics, which have a short retention period. Ephemeral metrics are retained for 28 days, whereas persistent (default) metrics are retained for 18 months. For details, see [Metric Types per Retention Period](metric_types.html#metric-types-per-retention-period).

  {% include note.html content="By default, all ingested metrics are persistent but are now convertible to ephemeral."%}

  On the Metrics Browser:
  
  * All users can view the type of each metric - persistent or ephemeral.
  * Super Admin users can convert metrics from persistent to ephemeral and the reverse. For details, see [Change the Retention Period of Metrics](metrics_managing.html#change-the-retention-period-of-metrics).
    
  ![A screenshot of the Metrics Browser with highlighted the new Type column and the new Change Ephemerality button.](images/metrics_browser_RNs.png)

  {% include note.html content="Converting persistent metrics to ephemeral improves the [query performance](query_language_performance.html) and reduces the [cardinality](cardinality.html). Consider converting metrics that are relevant for a short time and that have high cardinality, such as the Kubernetes metrics (`kubernetes.`). "%}

* **Replace all `~agent.` metrics with `~proxy.`**: The `~agent.` metrics were deprecated a few years ago. With this release, our service no longer supports the `~agent.` metrics. You must replace all the `~agent.` metrics with `~proxy.` to ensure that your charts donâ€™t break.

  For example: 

  ```
  # Deprecated metric: 
  rawsum(align(1m, mean, ts(\"~agent.buffer.task-count\")))

  # Replace with:
  rawsum(align(1m, mean, ts(\"~proxy.buffer.task-count\")))
  ``````

## 2024-03.x Release Notes

* **Updated Support Link**: The link for contacting our Technical Support team from within the Operations for Applications user interface is now updated. To open a support ticket, click the gear icon <i class="fa fa-cog"/> on the toolbar and select **Support**.

* **Derived Metrics Browser Improvements**: We improved the user experience of the **Derived Metrics Browser**. To navigate to this page, select **Browse > Derived Metrics**.

  ![An annotated screenshot of the Derived Metrics Browser. The information is listed below](images/derived_metrics.png)

  On this page, now you can:

  * Apply various filters and hide or show the filters listed on the left.
  * Search for derived metrics, save and share searches.
  * Click **Create Derived Metric** to add a derived metric.
  * Choose to display only the existing or only the deleted derived metrics.

  * Use the ellipsis icon menu to:
    * Edit, clone, or delete an existing derived metric.
    * Restore or permanently delete a deleted derived metric.
  * Select one or more derived metrics to add or remove specific tags for them, or to delete them.
