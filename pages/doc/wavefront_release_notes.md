## Announcement

Starting July 3, 2023, VMware Aria Operations for Applications is a service on the [VMware Cloud services platform](https://console.cloud.vmware.com/). After this date, we support two types of subscriptions: 

* **Onboarded Subscriptions**: Operations for Applications subscriptions that are onboarded to the VMware Cloud services platform. 
* **Original Subscriptions**: Existing subscriptions which remain as is until they migrate to VMware Cloud services. 
   
   We are in the process of incrementally migrating original subscriptions to VMware Cloud services.

For information about the two subscription types and how they differ, see [Subscription Types](subscriptions-differences.html).
 
{% include note.html content="We will support both original and onboarded subscriptions until all original subscriptions are migrated to VMware Cloud services."%}

  * If you are querying for a time series that has not reported points within the last **14 days**, you must select to [Include Obsolete Metrics](https://docs.wavefront.com/metrics_managing.html#obsolete-metrics) for your [charts](https://docs.wavefront.com/ui_charts.html#include-metrics-that-stopped-reporting) or [dashboards](https://docs.wavefront.com/ui_dashboards.html#set-dashboard-display-preferences-and-settings). 
  * If the data you are querying for does have data points within the last **14 days**, you do not need to do anything.

  If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to [contact us](mailto:support@wavefront.com).

* **Alert Checking Frequency**: When you create an alert, the default alert checking frequency is now set to 5 minutes.
