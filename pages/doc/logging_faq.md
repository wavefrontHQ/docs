## My Logging Solution Doesn't Use the Default Attributes

You can use the [proxy configuration properties](logging_proxy_configurations.html) to map attributes your logs are using to attributes our logging solution expects, as follows:

<table>
<tr>
  <th width="30%">
  Expected log attribute
  </th>
  <th width="70%">
  Proxy property to change the attribute
  </th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>timestamp </td>
<td>customTimestampTags</td> </tr>
<tr><td>message </td>
<td>customMessageTags </td> </tr>
<tr><td>application </td>
<td>customApplicationTags  </td> </tr>
<tr><td>service </td>
<td>customServiceTags </td> </tr>
</table>


## Why Don't I See Logs When I Drill Down From a Chart?

If you right-click on a chart and select **Logs (Beta)**, you're directed to the Logs Browser. If you don't see data on the Logs Browser, here are some things to explore:
* If your chart has data from more than one source and you didn't select the target source, the Logs Browser cannot show the logs because this feature shows logs from only one source. To see the data corresponding to the chart query but focused on one source, select a source in the Logs Browser and click **Search**.
* If you have not tagged your log data using the corresponding source value when you sent the logs from your log shipper, you might see no search results in the Logs Browser. See [What’s a Log?](logging_overview.html#whats-a-tanzu-observability-log) for details on the log syntax.

## Why Are Some of the Logs Tags Missing?

Our logging solution expects that certain tags are defined in the logs that you send in.

You can use proxy configuration properties to map the tags that your log shipper is using to the tags that our solution expects. See [Logs Proxy Configurations and Preprocessor Rules](logging_proxy_configurations.html).

{{site.data.alerts.note}}
  <ul>
    <li>
      There may be a marginal cost increase for additional tags.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you're using our <a href="tracing_basics.html">distributed tracing</a>, use the same <code>application</code> and <code>service</code> tags in both places to map from the tracing GUI to the Logs Browser.
    </li>
  </ul>
{{site.data.alerts.end}}


If you are using Fluentd, you can specify the `application` and `service` in the `fluent.conf` file as follows:
```
<filter **>
  @type record_transformer
  enable_ruby
  <record>
    service "<INSERT_YOUR_SERVICE_HERE>"
    application "<INSERT_YOUR_APPLICATION_HERE>"
    #source "#{ENV['MY_NODE_NAME']}"
    timestamp ${time.to_datetime().strftime('%Q')}
  </record>
</filter>

```

## How Do I Track Data Blocked by the Wavefront Proxy?

The Wavefront proxy drops the logs that exceed the [maximum character limit](logging_send_logs.html#limits-for-logs) for a message, tag, and value. To track the incoming log data and the number of logs that are blocked by the proxy:
1. Find the integration-systems-with-logs.json file that was shared with you when signing up as a logs Beta customer.
1. Log in to your Wavefront instance and select **Dashboards** > **Create Dashboards**.
1. Click **JSON** in the top-left corner.
    ![a screenshot of the UI with the JSON link highlighted.](images/logging_dashboard_json.png)
1. Select **Code** from the drop-down menu and open the editor.
    <br/>![Screenshot of the drop down menu mentioned in the step.](images/dashboard_code_view.png)
1. Copy the content in the JSON file, paste it into the editor, and click **Accept**.
1. In the top right of the dashboard that appears, click **Save**.
    ![a screenshot of the UI with Save highlighted.](images/logging_dashboard_save.png)
1. Examine the charts in the **Logs Stats** section of the [Wavefront Service and Proxy Data dashboard](wavefront_monitoring.html#wavefront-service-and-proxy-data-dashboard) to get details about the logs you are sending.

    ![A screenshot of the proxy dashboard with the preconfigured charts.](images/logging_proxy_logs_dashboard.png)

    {% include note.html content="[Examine Data with Dashboards and charts](ui_examine_data.html) explains how explore dashboards and includes videos and links." %}

    - In the **Blocked Logs per Second** chart, you can see how many logs were blocked.
    - In the **Proxy Backlog Size (Bytes)** chart, non-zero values indicate that the proxy is having issues delivering data.
1. In the [Metrics Browser](metrics_managing.html), search for metrics in the `~proxy.log.*` namespace. Can be `logSourceMissing`, `logSourceTooLong`, `logMessageTooLong`, `tooManyLogTags`, `logAnnotationKeyTooLong`, `logAnnotationKeyBadChars`, `logAnnotationValueEmpty`, and `logAnnotationValueTooLong`
  
    {% include note.html content="If you see `~proxy.log.*TooLong` or `~proxy.log.tooManyLogTags` metrics, check the [limits for logs](logging_send_logs.html#limits-for-logs). If you want to increase the logs limits for your Wavefront instance, contact [technical support](wavefront_support_feedback.html#support)." %}
1. In the [Logs Browser](logging_log_browser.html), search for logs containing the following message:

    ```
    INFO  [AbstractReportableEntityHandler:reject] [2878] blocked input:
    ```
    You can see why the log was rejected and the actual log message.

## Why Do I See a `pattern not match` Error in the Fluentd Logs?

If your application runs on a Kubernetes cluster, and if you see a `pattern not match` error in the Fluentd logs, Fluentd scrapes the logs on your application but does not send them to the Wavefront proxy. Add the following configuration to your `fluent.conf` file to resolve the `pattern not match` error:

```
<pattern>
  format regexp
  expression /^(?<time>.+) (?<stream>stdout|stderr)( (.))? (?<log>.*)$/
  time_format '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%NZ'
  keep_time_key false
</pattern>
```

## How Do I Know If the Proxy Receives Data?

If you don't see your data on the Logs Browser, you might not know if there's a problem with the log shipper or with the Wavefront proxy.

To confirm that the Wavefront proxy is sending data, follow these steps:

1. Run the following curl command to send a log to the proxy as a JSON payload:

    ```
    curl --location --request POST 'http://<Proxy_Host>:<Proxy_Port>/logs/json_array?f=logs_json_arr' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-raw '[
        {
            "message": "test message",
            "source": "localhost",
            "application": "test_application",
            "test_label": "label1"
        }
    ]'
    ```
    {% include tip.html content="For information on the log format, see [What’s a Tanzu Observability Log?](logging_overview.html#whats-a-tanzu-observability-log)" %}

    For example, use the following command if you are running the proxy locally and using port 2878:

    ```
    curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:2878/logs/json_array?f=logs_json_arr' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-raw '[
        {
            "message": "test message",
            "source": "localhost",
            "application": "test_application",
            "test_label": "label1"
        }
    ]'
    ```
    {% include note.html content="If you get the following error message: **Failed to connect to localhost port 2878: Connection refused**, the problem is likely that the proxy is not running." %}

1. Verify that the data that is sent from the log shipper to the proxy is then sent by the proxy to the Wavefront service, as follows:
    1. Log in to your Wavefront instance.
    1. On the toolbar, click **Logs**.
    1. In the Logs Browser, click **applications** under **All Tags**.
    1. Click **test_application** (or the value of the application tag in the log message you sent).

* If the proxy is sending data but you don't see your log data, check that the log shipper is configured correctly.
* If you don't see the data, check your proxy configuration and ensure, for example, that the port and URL are correct.
