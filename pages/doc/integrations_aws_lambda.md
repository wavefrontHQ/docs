On this page, we give some background and details not available on the integration page.

## Tanzu Observability and AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda is ideal for situations when you want to run a function in response to an event. Use cases include generating thumbnails whenever users upload images to a website or similar scenarios. You define the function in one of the languages that AWS Lambda supports, and the function runs whenever a triggering event occurs. This model is called Function-as-a-Service or serverless.

While it's convenient to stop worrying about function execution, you might want to monitor the function. We offer these choices to monitor your AWS Lambda function:
* Use the Amazon CloudWatch integration. Using the CloudWatch integration allows access to the full set of standard metrics, but polling CloudWatch and send the data to Tanzu Observability introduces some lag.
* Use the [AWS Lambda Functions integration](aws-lambda-functions.html). The integration collects standard metrics available through the public API. It also allows you to monitor business metrics by using a wrapper in Python, Go, or Node.js.
  - [Go SDK for AWS Lambda](https://github.com/wavefrontHQ/wavefront-lambda-go)
  - [Node.js SDK for AWS Lambda](https://github.com/wavefrontHQ/wavefront-lambda-nodejs)
  - [Python SDK for AWS Lambda](https://github.com/wavefrontHQ/wavefront-lambda-python)

## How to Use Tanzu Observability to Monitor AWS Lambda

To support monitoring serverless environments, we include a metric type called [delta counter](delta_counters.html). With delta counters, Tanzu Observability points are aggregated to the minute bucket. That avoids point collisions.

The AWS Lambda Function integration and the SDKs listed above make it easy to collect standard metrics and custom metrics.

## Ingesting AWS Lambda Cold Start Metrics into Tanzu Observability

An AWS Lambda "cold start" is the first request that a new AWS Lambda instance handles. Once the request is complete, the instance stays up-and-running, so that it can handle the subsequent requests. There is no defined time when this first instance will be removed. If an instance has been accidentally removed, "cold start" will happen again. As a result, the response time increases, because "cold start" will keep happening and you won't be able to find the cause behind this.

You can overcome this situation, by reporting a new metric to the product service which allows you monitor the "cold start" duration. In many cases, the AWS Lambda "cold start" metrics are not being reported to CloudWatch. They are just logged.

### Step 1: Create an IAM Policy in AWS

1. Log in to your AWS account.
1. Search for the **IAM** (AWS Identity and Access Management) service and click it.
1. Under **Access Management** click **Policies**.
1. Click the **Create policy** button. 
1. Click the **JSON** tab, enter the following snippet, and click **Next: Tags**.
    ```
    {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "logs:CreateLogGroup",
                "logs:CreateLogStream",
                "logs:PutLogEvents",
                "cloudwatch:PutMetricData"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
          }
        ]
     }
     ```
1. Click **Next: Review**, provide a meaningful name (for example, `aws-cold-start-policy`) and, optionally, a description of the policy, and click **Create policy**.

### Step 2: Create a Role in AWS and Assign the Policy to It

1. Under **Access management** on the left, click **Roles**.
1. Click **Create role**.
1. Click the **AWS service** tile, select the **Lambda** radio button, and click **Next**.
1. Search for the permission policy that you have created in Step 1 (in our example, this is `aws-cold-start-policy`), select it, and click **Next**.
1. Provide a meaningful name (for example, `aws-cold-start-role`) and, optionally, a description of the role, and click **Create role**.

### Step 3: Create the AWS Lambda Function

Create a function and subscribe to it from your AWS Lambda function. This function will take care of filtering the cold start metrics and will report them to CloudWatch.

1. In your AWS Management Console, search for the **Lambda** service and click it.
1. Click the **Create function** button, and leave the **Author from scratch** tile selected.
1. Enter the name of the function, for example `aws-cold-start-lambda-function`.
1. From the **Runtime** menu, select **Python 3.9** as the language to use to write your function. 
1. Under **Architecture**, leave **x86_64** selected.
1. Expand **Change default execution role**, select **Use an existing role** and select the role that you created in Step 2. For example, `aws-cold-start-role`.
1. Click **Create function**.

### Step 4: Deploy the Lambda Function

1. Navigate to the newly created Lambda function (`aws-cold-start-lambda-function`) and click it.
1. On the **Code** tab, under the **aws-cold-start-lambda-function** folder, select **lambda_function.py**
1. Add the following code snippet and click **Deploy**.

    ```
    import boto3
    import logging
    import json
    import gzip
    import base64
    from io import StringIO
     
    logger = logging.getLogger()
    logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
    cloudwatch = boto3.client('cloudwatch')
     
    def lambda_handler(event, context):
        cw_data = event['awslogs']['data']
        compressed_payload = base64.b64decode(cw_data)
        uncompressed_payload = gzip.decompress(compressed_payload)
        payload = json.loads(uncompressed_payload)
        logEvents = payload.get("logEvents")[0]
        extractedFields = logEvents.get("extractedFields")
        response = cloudwatch.put_metric_data(
        MetricData = [
            {
                'MetricName': 'custom.initDuration',
                'Dimensions': [
                    {
                        'Name': 'logGroup',
                        'Value': payload.get("logGroup")
                    }
                ],
                'Unit': 'Milliseconds',
                'Value': float(extractedFields.get("lambda_init_duration_ms"))
            },
        ],
        Namespace = 'AWS/Lambda'
        )
        if response.get("ResponseMetadata").get("HTTPStatusCode") != 200:
            logger.error(response)
     
        return {
            'statusCode': response.get("ResponseMetadata").get("HTTPStatusCode"),
            'body': response.get("ResponseMetadata")
        }
      ```

### Step 5: Create a Subscription Filter

Subscribe to the Lambda function that you've just created from the existing AWS Lambda function for which you want to monitor "cold start" metrics.

1. In your AWS Management Console, search for the **Lambda** service and click it.
1. Navigate to your Lambda function and click it.
1. Click **Monitor**.
   ![A screenshot of the AWS Lambda function screen with the Monitor and Logs tabs selected.](images/aws-lambda-1.png)
1. Click **View logs in CloudWatch**.
1. On the **Subscription filters** tab, click **Create** and select **Create Lambda subscription filter**.
1. From the **Lambda function** drop-down menu, select the Lambda function you want to subscribe to the filter. 
    In our example, this is `aws-cold-start-lambda-function`.
1. From the **Log format** drop-down menu, select **JSON**.
1. In the **Subscription filter pattern** text box, enter the following snippet.
  

    ```
    [ 
    report_label=REPORT, request_id_label=RequestId*, request_id_value, duration_label=Duration*, lambda_duration_ms, duration_unit=ms, billed_duration_label1=Billed, bill_duration_label2=Duration*, lambda_billed_duration_ms, billed_duration_unit=ms, memory_size_label1=Memory, memory_size_label2=Size*, lambda_memory_size_mb, memory_size_unit=MB, max_memory_used_label1=Max, max_memory_used_label2=Memory, max_memory_used_label3=Used*, lambda_max_memory_used_mb, max_memory_used_unit=MB, init_duration_label1=Init, init_duration_label2=Duration*, lambda_init_duration_ms, init_duration_unit=ms 
    ]

    ```
1. In the **Subscription filter name** text box, provide a name and click **Start streaming**.
1. Navigate to your product cluster and in the Metrics Browser search for the `aws.lambda.custom.initduration` metric.

   {% include important.html content="The `aws.lambda.custom.initduration` metric starts flowing only when cold start happens." %}

### Sending Business Metrics to the AWS Lambda Integration

If you want to go beyond standard metrics and monitor business metrics, that is, metrics associated with your AWS Lambda function, you can publish those directly from your Lambda function into Wavefront with very little additional code. You specify the metric(s) you want to send to Wavefront in a wrapper for your Lambda function. Instructions and links are in the AWS Lambda integration, or you can look at the [example on Github](https://github.com/wavefrontHQ/python-client/blob/master/wavefront_lambda/example.py).

Wavefront supports wrappers for Python, Go, and Node.js.

### Sending AWS Lambda Metrics to the Wavefront Proxy or Service

If you don't want to use the AWS Lambda integration, you can send metrics directly to the Wavefront proxy or directly to the Wavefront service (direct ingestions).

If you want to send delta metrics, you prefix each metric with a delta character, as shown in the following [sample code](https://github.com/wavefrontHQ/python-client/blob/master/wavefront_pyformance/wavefront_pyformance/delta.py) snippet.

```
DELTA_PREFIX = u"\u2206"
ALT_DELTA_PREFIX = u"\u0394"

...
name = name if _has_delta_prefix(name) else DeltaCounter.DELTA_PREFIX + name
```
See the [sample code](https://github.com/wavefrontHQ/python-client/blob/master/wavefront_pyformance/wavefront_pyformance/delta.py) for details.
