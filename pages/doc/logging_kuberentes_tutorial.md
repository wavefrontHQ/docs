{% include important.html content="Tanzu Observability Logs (Beta) is only enabled for selected customers. If you'd like to participate, contact your [Tanzu Observability account representative](wavefront_support_feedback.html#support)."%}

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to **send logs** from your local Kubernetes environment using **minikube** to **Tanzu Observability**. Once the data is in Tanzu Observability, you can use the Log Browser to search and filter logs.

## Prerequisites

* Make sure that you have a Tanzu Observability by Wavefront account which gives you access to a cluster. 
  <!--If you don’t have a cluster, [sign up for a free trial](https://tanzu.vmware.com/observability-trial).-->
* Generate a Tanzu Observability API token linked to an account with the **Proxy** permission. See [Generating an API Token](wavefront_api.html#generating-an-api-token).
* [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). You’ll run the Wavefront proxy on Docker for this tutorial.
* Install minikube. Follow [step 1 on the minikube start guide](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/).
* Clone the sample repository.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/wavefrontHQ/logging-examples.git
    ```

<!-- * Whitelist the VMware domain (`*.vmware.com`).
  Tanzu Observability uses the VMware log server as part of its architecture. Therefore, to send your log data successfully, you need to whitelist the VMware domain. -->

## Send Logs to Tanzu Observability

Follow these steps to install the Wavefront proxy, start minikube, and then send the logs to Tanzu Observability:

1. Run the Wavefront proxy.
    1. Start the Wavefront proxy on Docker: 
        ```
        docker run -d \
          -e WAVEFRONT_URL=https://{INSTANCE_NAME}.wavefront.com/ \
          -e WAVEFRONT_TOKEN={TOKEN} \
          -e WAVEFRONT_PROXY_ARGS="--pushFlushMaxLogs 150 --customMessageTags log" \
          -e JAVA_HEAP_USAGE=512m \
          -p 2878:2878 \
          wavefronthq/proxy:latest
        ```

        {% include note.html content="Here, replace `{INSTANCE_NAME}` with the name of your Wavefront cluster and {`TOKEN}` with the  API token that you generated."%}
        
        {% include important.html content="If you previously started the Wavefront proxy on Docker, delete the old image to download the latest release. Use the commands listed below: " %}
        ```
        # stop the container
        docker stop <running CONTAINER ID>
        
        # remove the docker image
        docker rmi wavefronthq/proxy:latest
        
        # now, run the command in step 1 again.
        ```

    1. List the container IDs and copy the container ID of the proxy.
        ```
        docker ps
        ```
    1. Tail the logs for the proxy.
        ```
        docker logs <PROXY_CONTAINER_ID> --follow
        ```
1. Run Kubernetes on your local environment.
    1. Open a new terminal window and start minikube.
        ```
        minikube start --driver=docker
        ```
        
    1. Send the requests from your local machine to the Kubernetes cluster you started using minikube.
        ```
        minikube addons enable ingress
        kubectl port-forward service/ingress-nginx-controller -n ingress-nginx 8080:80
        ```
1. Run the Fluentd log shipper.
    1. Open a new terminal window and navigate to the directory you cloned in the Prerequisites
        ```
        cd <folder_path>/logging-examples
        ```
    1. Create a config map from the config file.
        ```
        kubectl create configmap fluentdconfigmap --from-file=fluent.conf -n kube-system
        ```
    1. Install Fluentd as a daemonset.
        ```
        kubectl apply -f fluentd.yaml
        ```
    1. Verify that you see the Fluentd pod you just installed.
        ```
        kubectl get pods -n kube-system
        ```
        Example output:
        ```
        NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS        AGE
        fluentd-wf-logging-jqwbz           1/1     Running   0               119s
        ```
1. Start the services.
    1. Start the development service.
        ```
        kubectl apply -f pod_dev.yaml
        ```
    
    1. Start the staging service.
        ```
        kubectl apply -f pod_staging.yaml
        ```
1. Tail the logs of the service.
    1. In a new terminal window, get the name of the development service, and copy the name.
        ```
        kubectl get pods --namespace development
        ```
        Example output:
        ```
        NAME                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
        app1-6ddbdb8486-9f762   1/1     Running   0          2m15s
        ```
        
    1. Tail the logs of the development service. 
        ```
        kubectl logs  <container_id> --follow --namespace development
        ```
        Here, replace `<container_id>` with the development service name that you copied.
        
    1. In a new terminal window, get the name of the staging services, and copy the name.
        ```
        kubectl get pods --namespace staging
        ```
    1. Tail the logs of the staging service.
        ```
        kubectl logs <container_id> --follow --namespace staging
        ```
        Here, replace `<container_id>` with the staging service name that you copied.
        
1. Access the services you just started:
    1. To access the development service, use the following URL: [http://localhost:8080/service1](http://localhost:8080/service1)
    1. To access the staging service, use the following URL: [http://localhost:8080/service2](http://localhost:8080/service2)
    
## Search and Filter Logs 

Once Tanzu Observability receives the data, you can:
* Search and filter logs on the Log Browser.
* See the logs related to alerts.
* Drill into logs from a chart, Application Map, and the Traces Browser.

Follow these steps:
1. In your web browser, go to your Wavefront instance and log in.
1. On the toolbar, click **Logs**. You see the Log Browser.
1. Click **application** and select **my_app**. 
    {% include tip.html content="If **Auto Search** is on, the search results show up on theLog Browser page when you add a source, tag, or word(s) to the search bar. If **Auto Search** is off, to get the search results, click **Search**. "%}

## Clean Up the Content

Follow these steps to delete the content that you created for this tutorial.

1. Navigate to each terminal where you have a service running and press **Ctrl** + **C** to stop the services.

1. Stop the proxy container running on Docker.
    ```
    # get the container ID for the wavefront Proxy
    docker ps
    
    # stop the Proxy
    docker stop <CONTAINER ID>
    ```
    {% include important.html content="Don’t stop minukube. To remove all configurations, you need minikube running till the end of this procedure." %}
1. Delete the proxy image. 
    ```
    docker rmi wavefronthq/proxy:latest
    ```
    If you are prompted to remove the image forcefully, append `--force` to the end of the command.

1. Delete the Fluentd config map.

    ```
    kubectl delete configmap    fluentdconfigmap  -n   kube-system
    ```

    kubectl delete -f Fluentd.yaml
    ```

1. Delete the Kubernetes service that you created using the `pod_dev.yaml` file.
    ```
    kubectl delete -f pod_dev.yaml
    ```

1. Delete the Kubernetes service that you created using the `pod_staging.yaml` file.
    ```
    kubectl delete -f pod_staging.yaml
    ```
    
1. Stop the minikube instance running on Docker.
    ```
    # get the container ID for minikube
    docker ps
    
    # stop the minikube instance
    docker stop <CONTAINER ID>
