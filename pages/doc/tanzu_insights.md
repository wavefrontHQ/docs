summary: Monitor resources using VMware Tanzu Insights in Tanzu Hub.
---

The Tanzu Insights capabilities in Tanzu Hub collect and aggregate events and alerts from various systems, including Tanzu Observability and native public accounts. Tanzu Insights then correlates the alerts and events and helps you monitor your resources, identify and prioritize those that need your attention, and provide data to help you troubleshoot and resolve problems.

As the first step, you need to send data to the Tanzu Hub so that you can use the Tanzu Insights capabilities. For detailed instructions, see the [Tanzu Hub documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Hub/SaaS/Using-and-Managing-VMware-Tanzu-Hub/GUID-D379CBB6-3777-41C4-A8AC-2FA34A1B6FA7.html#how-to-set-up-a-vmware-aria-operations-for-applications-source-4).

Once the data is in, you can see the observations and the insights when you click Insights.
