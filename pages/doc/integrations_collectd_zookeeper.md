summary: Learn how to send ZooKeeper data collected by collectd to Tanzu Observability (formerly known as VMware Aria Operations for Applications).

[Apache ZooKeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/) is a popular service for maintaining configuration and coordinating distributed systems. ZooKeeper is used by technologies like Hadoop and Apache Solr to coordinate clusters and help them run reliably. Tanzu Observability supports a built-in integration that gets data from ZooKeeper using Telegraf. If you want to use collectd instead, follow the instructions on this page. 

The collectd ZooKeeper plugin documentation can be found at [collectd.conf(5) – collectd – The system statistics collection daemon](https://collectd.org/documentation/manpages/collectd.conf.5.shtml#plugin_zookeeper).


## Installation

1. On your collectd host, copy the config below into `/etc/collectd/managed_config/`.
1. Edit the settings in the file for your ZooKeeper servers.
1. Restart collectd.

## Example collectd Configuration
