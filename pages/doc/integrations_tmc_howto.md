[VMware Tanzu Mission Control](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Mission-Control/services/tanzumc-concepts/GUID-E2B5BE05-596E-4999-9B21-1CDB875A1BBF.html) provides a centralized management platform for consistently operating and securing your Kubernetes infrastructure and modern applications across multiple teams and clouds.

This document explains
* How to set up and enable the integration from Tanzu Mission Control to Tanzu Observability by Wavefront.
* How to monitor your Kubernetes environment with our pre-defined dashboards, and how to clone and customize those dashboards.
* How to troubleshoot common problems.

<!---
If you want to monitor Tanzu Mission Control with Wavefront, you have two options:
* Set up an integration from Tanzu Mission Control (preferred). The integrations establishes a credentials exchange and makes it easy to monitor any cluster that Tanzu Mission Control manages.
* Monitor individual clusters by using the Wavefront integration with Kubernetes.--->

## Create the Credential

To get started, you set up the integration from Tanzu Mission Control to Tanzu Observability by Wavefront:

### Step 1: In Your Wavefront Cluster, Generate an API Token

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="50%">In your Wavefront cluster, <a href="integrations_tmc.html#generate-a-service-account-api-token-for-tanzu-mission-control">Generate a Service Account API Token for Tanzu Mission Control</a>.
</td>
<td width="50%"><img src="/images/tmc_service_account_create.png" alt="Create service account dialog with name and description filled in."></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Step 2: In Tanzu Mission Control, Set Up the Integration

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="50%">In the Tanzu Mission Control console:
<ol><li>Select <strong>Administration &gt; Accounts</strong>. </li>
<li>Click <strong>Create Account Credential</strong> and select <strong>Tanzu Observability credential.</strong></li>
</ol>
</td>
<td width="50%"><img src="/images/tmc_create_credential.png" alt="Pulldown menu shows Tanzu Observability credential as the third item"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">On the <strong>Create Tanzu Observability credential</strong> page, specify credential attributes:
<ul>
<li><strong>Credential Name</strong>. Name that starts and ends with a letter and contains only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. Best practice is to include the name of the Wavefront instance in the credential name. Do NOT use the name of the service account. </li>
<li><strong>Tanzu Observability URL</strong>. The URL of the Wavefront cluster, for example, <code>https://demo.wavefront.com</code></li>
<li><strong>Tanzu Observability API Token</strong>. The API token that you generated inside the Wavefront instance. </li>
</ul> </td>
<td width="50%"><img src="/images/tmc_create_credential_page.png" alt="Create Tanzu Observability page with 3 fields filled in"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">Click the <strong>Integrations</strong> tab and verify that Tanzu Observability by Wavefront is enabled. If you don't see the integration as enabled after a few minutes, see the Troubleshooting section below.
</td>
<td width="50%"><img src="/images/tmc_enabled.png" alt="Screenshot shows Tanzu Observability is enabled."></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


{% include tip.html content="For details, see the [Tanzu Mission Control documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Mission-Control/services/tanzumc-using/GUID-A70E57A8-2C45-46D4-8E1F-6D5E7026473F.html)" %}

## Enable Tanzu Observability for a Cluster in Tanzu Mission Control

After you have set up the credential from Tanzu Mission Control, you can start enabling Tanzu Observability for individual clusters that are managed by Tanzu Mission Control.


<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="50%">
<ol>
<li>In Tanzu Mission Control, select <strong>Clusters</strong> and pick the cluster that you want to monitor. </li>
<li>In the <strong>Integrations</strong> tile, click <strong>Add Integration</strong> and select <strong>Tanzu Observability</strong>. </li>
<li>In the <strong>Add Tanzu Observability</strong> dialog, select the credential that is associated with the Wavefront instance that you want to use for monitoring.</li>
<li>After a few minutes, the <strong>Integrations</strong> tile shows the Tanzu Mission Control Adapter status <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol> </td>
<td width="50%"><img src="/images/tmc_add_credential_to_cluster.png" alt="Tanzu Observability Integration dialog with pulldown menu showing credentials. "></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

You can now click the link to Tanzu Observability. You are redirected to a dashboard in the Wavefront instance that shows the metrics for the cluster.

## Examine Your Cluster's Data in Dashboards

Dashboards allow you to drill down into your data, change the time window, examine individual charts, use filters, and much more.

[Visualize Kubernetes Data with Wavefront](wavefront_kubernetes.html#visualize-kubernetes-data) has some specific information. For a general overview of dashboards and charts, see [Examine Data with Dashboards and Charts](ui_examine_data.html) or watch this short video. You can also watch the video <a href="https://vmwaretv.vmware.com/media/t/1_gunwcmwm/252649793" target="_blank">here <img src="/images/video_camera.png" alt="video camera icon"/></a>.

</p>

The Kubernetes dashboard that you land on from Tanzu Mission Control has several sections with detailed information.

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="50%">
Scroll down for red flags on the dashboard, or use the <strong>Jump To</strong> menu to focus on the section you're interested in.</td>
<td width="50%"><img src="/images/tmc_jump_to.png" alt="Tanzu Observability Integration dialog with pulldown menu showing credentials. "></td></tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">
If you want to customize the charts in the dashboards or add more charts, you can clone the existing dashboard:
<ol>
<li>Select <strong>Clone</strong> from the ellipsis menu in the top right.</li>
<li>Give the cloned dashboard a name and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
You must have the <strong>Dashboards</strong> permission inside Tanzu Observability by Wavefront to clone or edit a dashboard. </td>

## Troubleshooting

For some general recommendations,  [Kubernetes Troubleshooting](wf_kubernetes_troubleshooting.html). The following causes for failure and remediation steps are especially useful for Tanzu Mission Control troubleshooting.

### Symptoms

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="50%" markdown="span">
If the integration wasnâ€™t set up successfully, the icon in the Integrations tile shows <strong>Needs Attention</strong> and the wavefront-extension icon in the Agent and extensions health tile shows Unhealthy. <br/>
<img src="/images/tmc_needs_attention.png " alt="Integrations tile shows Needs Attention">
</td>
<td width="50%"><img src="/images/tmc_wavefront_extension_bad.png" alt="wavefront-extension icon shows Unhealthy"></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Causes

Failures might be caused by several issues including the following:

* Policy restrictions (access permission for pod)
* Nodes are not available for scheduling
* Not enough memory or CPU is available
* Image cannot be pulled
* Pod crash due to internal access logic error
* General issue on the Tanzu Mission Control side
* Issue with credential, for example, the API token might have been revoked on the Tanzu Observability by Wavefront side.

### Remediation

Follow these steps to remediate problems:
1. Ensure that the cluster you want to connect to isn't protected by an SSO solution. If it is, you might have to explicitly log in to the cluster as a user before you can display the dashboard.
2. Ensure that the Wavefront API key is active and correctly entered. If the key was revoked, it's no longer valid.
