summary: Monitor clusters in Tanzu Mission Control.

[VMware Tanzu Mission Control](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Mission-Control/services/tanzumc-concepts/GUID-E2B5BE05-596E-4999-9B21-1CDB875A1BBF.html) provides a centralized management platform for consistently operating and securing your Kubernetes infrastructure and modern applications across multiple teams and clouds.

This document explains:
* How to set up and enable the integration from Tanzu Mission Control to VMware Aria Operations for Applications (formerly known as Tanzu Observability by Wavefront).
* How to monitor your Kubernetes environment with our pre-defined dashboards, and how to clone and customize those dashboards.
* How to troubleshoot common problems.

<!---
If you want to monitor Tanzu Mission Control with Wavefront, you have two options:
* Set up an integration from Tanzu Mission Control (preferred). The integrations establishes a credentials exchange and makes it easy to monitor any cluster that Tanzu Mission Control manages.
* Monitor individual clusters by using the Wavefront integration with Kubernetes.--->

## Create the Credential

To get started, you set up the integration from Tanzu Mission Control to VMware Aria Operations for Applications:

### Step 1: Generate an API Token

* If your Operations for Applications service **is** onboarded to VMware Cloud services, see [How do I generate API tokens](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-services/services/Using-VMware-Cloud-Services/GUID-E2A3B1C1-E9AD-4B00-A6B6-88D31FCDDF7C.html) and [How do I manage API tokens in my Organization](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-services/services/Using-VMware-Cloud-Services/GUID-3A9C29E0-460B-4586-B51A-084443A960D0.html) in the VMware Cloud services documentation. You can also use an API token of a [server to server app](csp_server_to_server_apps.html) that can run queries.
* If your Operations for Applications service is **not** onboarded to VMware Cloud services, generate the API token in the Operations for Applications UI. See [Managing API tokens](api_tokens.html).

### Step 2: In Tanzu Mission Control, Set Up the Integration

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="50%">In the Tanzu Mission Control console:
<ol><li>Select <strong>Administration &gt; Accounts</strong>. </li>
<li>Click <strong>Create Account Credential</strong> and select <strong>Tanzu Observability credential.</strong></li>
</ol>
</td>
<td width="50%"><img src="/images/tmc_create_credential.png" alt="Pulldown menu shows Tanzu Observability credential as the third item"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">On the <strong>Create Tanzu Observability credential</strong> page, specify credential attributes:
<ul>
<li><strong>Credential Name</strong>. Name that starts and ends with a letter and contains only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. Best practice is to include the name of the product instance in the credential name. Do NOT use the name of the service account. </li>
<li><strong>Tanzu Observability URL</strong>. The URL of your product cluster, for example, <code>https://demo.wavefront.com</code></li>
<li><strong>Tanzu Observability API Token</strong>. The API token that you generated in Step 1. </li>
</ul> </td>
<td width="50%"><img src="/images/tmc_create_credential_page.png" alt="Create Tanzu Observability page with 3 fields filled in"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">Click the <strong>Integrations</strong> tab and verify that Tanzu Observability by Wavefront is enabled. If you don't see the integration as enabled after a few minutes, see the Troubleshooting section below.

## Enable Operations for Applications for a Cluster in Tanzu Mission Control

After you have set up the credential from Tanzu Mission Control, you can start enabling VMware Aria Operations for Applications for individual clusters that are managed by Tanzu Mission Control.


<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="50%">
<ol>
<li>In Tanzu Mission Control, select <strong>Clusters</strong> and pick the cluster that you want to monitor. </li>
<li>In the <strong>Integrations</strong> tile, click <strong>Add Integration</strong> and select <strong>Tanzu Observability</strong>. </li>
<li>In the <strong>Add Tanzu Observability</strong> dialog, select the credential that is associated with the Wavefront instance that you want to use for monitoring.</li>
<li>After a few minutes, the <strong>Integrations</strong> tile shows the Tanzu Mission Control Adapter status <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol> </td>
<td width="50%"><img src="/images/tmc_add_credential_to_cluster.png" alt="Tanzu Observability Integration dialog with pulldown menu showing credentials. "></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

![Large screenshot of TMC UI with Clusters selected and Integrations tile visible](/images/tmc_cluster_integrated.png)

You can now click the link to VMware Aria Operations for Applications. You are redirected to a dashboard in the VMware Aria Operations for Applications instance that shows the metrics for the cluster.

## Examine Your Cluster's Data in Dashboards

Dashboards allow you to drill down into your data, change the time window, examine individual charts, use filters, and much more.

[Visualize Kubernetes Data](wavefront_kubernetes.html#visualize-kubernetes-data) has some specific information. For a general overview of dashboards and charts, see [Examine Data with Dashboards and Charts](ui_examine_data.html) or watch this short video. You can also watch the video <a href="https://vmwaretv.vmware.com/media/t/1_gunwcmwm/252649793" target="_blank">here <img src="/images/video_camera.png" alt="video camera icon"/></a>.

</p>

The Kubernetes dashboard that you land on from Tanzu Mission Control has several sections with detailed information.

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="50%">
Scroll down for red flags on the dashboard, or use the <strong>Jump To</strong> menu to focus on the section you're interested in.</td>
<td width="50%"><img src="/images/tmc_jump_to.png" alt="Tanzu Observability Integration dialog with pulldown menu showing credentials. "></td></tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">
If you want to customize the charts in the dashboards or add more charts, you can clone the existing dashboard:
<ol>
<li>Select <strong>Clone</strong> from the ellipsis menu in the top right.</li>
<li>Give the cloned dashboard a new name and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
You must have the <strong>Dashboards</strong> permission inside VMware Aria Operations for Applications to clone or edit a dashboard. </td>

## Troubleshooting

For some general recommendations,  [Kubernetes Troubleshooting](wf_kubernetes_troubleshooting.html). The following causes for failure and remediation steps are especially useful for Tanzu Mission Control troubleshooting.

### Integrations Tile Shows Needs Attention

**Symptom**

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="50%" markdown="span">
If the integration wasnâ€™t set up successfully, the icon in the Integrations tile shows <strong>Needs Attention</strong> and the wavefront-extension icon in the Agent and extensions health tile shows Unhealthy. <br/>
<img src="/images/tmc_needs_attention.png " alt="Integrations tile shows Needs Attention">
</td>
<td width="50%"><img src="/images/tmc_wavefront_extension_bad.png" alt="wavefront-extension icon shows Unhealthy"></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

**Possible Causes**

Failures might be caused by several issues including the following:

* Policy restrictions (access permission for pod)
* Nodes are not available for scheduling
* Not enough memory or CPU is available
* Image cannot be pulled
* Pod crash due to internal access logic error
* General issue on the Tanzu Mission Control side
* Issue with credential, for example, the API token might have been revoked.

**Remediation**

Follow these steps to remediate problems:
1. Ensure that the cluster you want to connect to isn't protected by an SSO solution. If it is, you might have to explicitly log in to the cluster as a user before you can display the dashboard.
2. Ensure that the Wavefront API key is active and correctly entered. If the key was revoked, it's no longer valid.

### Cannot Modify Proxy (Installed Through Tanzu Mission Control)

<!---This content also in proxies_troubleshooting.html--->

**Symptom**

You're monitoring your Kubernetes cluster with VMware Aria Operations for Applications. You installed VMware Aria Operations for Applications from Tanzu Mission Control. Now you're having problems making a change to the Wavefront proxy.

**Cause**

If you installed VMware Aria Operations for Applications from Tanzu Mission Control, you cannot make changes to the Wavefront proxy.

**Remediation**

If your environment has a standalone VMware Aria Operations for Applications instance, use that instance. We are working on resolving the issue.
