These release notes give an overview of the changes for Release 2020.22 of the VMware Aria Operations for Applications (previously known as Tanzu Observability by Wavefront) service.

{% include note.html content="[Tracing](tracing_basics.html) and [Histograms](proxies_histograms.html) are available by default for all customers starting with this release. Try them out and contact [support@wavefront.com](mailto:support@wavefront.com) if you have any questions." %}

## Alert Viewer

Starting with this release, newly created alert notifications include a link to the new Alert Viewer. Existing notifications continue to link to the Alert chart, but you can edit those notifications to also (or exclusively) link to the Alert Viewer.

From the Alert Viewer, you can view related alerts, drill down to responsible point tags, see past firings of the same alert, and more. Let us know what you think!


{% include note.html content="You can fine-tune what's included in the [alert notification](alerts_notifications.html)." %}

## Pie Chart

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="60%" markdown="span">The new [pie chart](ui_chart_reference.html#pie-and-donut-chart) lets you visualize data as pie slices or a donut. You can customize different aspects of this chart, for example, add a filter (Min, Max) or specify the maximum number of slices. The collage on the right shows both a pie chart and a donut chart for the same data.

## Enhanced and New Query Language Functions

This release includes enhancements to the following existing functions:

* The [`round` function](ts_round.html) now supports rounding to a specified multiple.
* The [`hw` predictive function](ts_hw.html) now supports double exponential smoothing. It continues to support triple exponential smoothing as before.
* The following standard time functions now support an optional second parameter (`<tsExpression>`):
  - `day()`
  - `month()`
  - `year()`
  - `weekday()`
  - `hour()`
  - `isToday()`
  - `dayOfYear()`

This release includes the following new functions:

* The [`linearforecast` function](ts_linearforecast.html) predicts the value of the time series using simple linear regression.
* The [`mslope` function](ts_mslope.html) returns the per-second derivative of the linear regression of a time series over a specified time window.
* The [`clampMax` function](ts_clampmax.html) changes any point greater than `max` to `max`.
* The [`clampMin` function](ts_clampmax.html) changes any point greater than `min` to `min`.
* Two new standard time functions, [`minute()`](ts_minute.html) and [`daysInMonth()`](ts_daysInMonth.html) are now available.
* The [`mchanges` function](ts_mchanges.html) returns the number of times a metric changed value within a specified time window.
* The [`missing` function](ts_missing.html) checks whether there are any data points in a specified time window.
* The [`mod` arithmetic function](ts_mod.html) returns the modulo of a division.
* The two new [`by` and `without` operators](query_language_aggregate_functions.html#grouping-with-by-or-without) simplify grouping with aggregation functions.

## Tracing UI Improvements

Easily analyze your traces hierarchy and RED metrics by clicking the expand or restore icon.
  * Click the expand icon to expand the RED metrics and view them next to the trace list and click the same icon again to restore to the default view.

## Log Integration

Troubleshoot anomalies on your metrics charts and drill down to view the logs that caused the issues. See [Access and Examine External Logs](log_integration.html) for details.

## Concurrent Query Limits

Wavefront enforces a limit on concurrent queries for each customer cluster. See [Concurrent Query Limits](wavefront_limits.html#concurrent-query-limits) for details and error messages.

## Other Changes

We made several other improvements, some of them in response to customer requests:

### Multi-Threshold Alerts Support Newline Character

For customers who use newline characters in alert conditions for better legibility, we now allow newline characters.

### Export PDF Option

An **Export PDF** option is now available from any v2 dashboard and from charts in Edit mode.

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="50%">For any chart, <strong>Export PDF</strong> is now available from the ellipsis menu in the top right. </td>
<td width="50%"><img src="/images/export_pdf_dashboard.png" alt="Export PDF from dashboard"/> </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">Click on the chart name and select the <strong>Export PDF</strong> icon in the top right. </td>
<td width="50%"><img src="/images/export_pdf_chart.png" alt="Export PDF from chart"/></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Additions to ~query.*.scanned Internal Metrics

New internal metrics allow you to monitor histograms and spans. The result is the following:

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="30%">~query.summaries_scanned</td>
<td width="70%">Per-second rate at which metrics are being queried from dashboards, alerts, charts or API calls.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="30%">~query.spans_scanned</td>
<td width="70%">Per-second rate at which spans are being queried from dashboards, alerts, charts or API calls.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="30%">~query.histograms_scanned</td>
<td width="70%">Per-second rate at which histograms are being queried from dashboards, alerts, charts or API calls.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Proxy 8.x

Wavefront Proxy 8.x supports incoming HTTPS connections and includes other miscellaneous improvement. See [Wavefront Proxy Release Notes](proxies_versions.html).

### Queries for All Data

To improve performance, we no longer allow queries for all data, that is, you can't query `ts(*)`. Include at least one filter in any query.
