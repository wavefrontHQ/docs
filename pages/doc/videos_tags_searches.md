<p>Understand how tagging can help you get the results that you need. By default, data include the metric name and the source. Cloud integrations include additional dimensions such as the AWS region, as point tags. You can add point tags to any data source from the UI or the API. Source tags are different. They allow you to group machines, for example, into db machines and web machines. You can then customize your queries to pull out just the data you need.</p>

<p>Want to learn how to organize information in Wavefront? Jason shows an example of assigning a tag (e.g. training) to several dashboards and how the tag can be used for filtering. He then uses additional tags in a hierarchy of tags (e.g. training.attendee and training.trainer) to support more fine-grained filtering using tag paths. Tag paths are available for dashboards, alerts, and events. Finally, for sources, Jason shows you can add source tags and filter directly from a query. </p>
