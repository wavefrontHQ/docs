Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a collection of cloud-computing services that provide an on-demand computing platform. The Amazon Web Services integration allows you to ingest metrics directly from AWS.

You can use the Amazon Web Services integration for initial setup, but additional steps might be needed for some of the services. This page gives an overview.

{% include note.html content="You must have the [**Proxy Management** permission](permissions_overview.html) to set up an AWS integration. If you do not have permission, the UI menu selections, buttons, and links you use to perform the tasks are not visible." %}

## Basics

The AWS integration ingests data from many Amazon and AWS products including:

- **[CloudWatch](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch)** -- retrieves AWS [metric and
dimension](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CW_Support_For_AWS.html) data. Includes some metrics for Amazon Relational Database (RDS).
- **[CloudTrail](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail)** -- retrieves EC2 event information and creates VMware Aria Operations for Applications (formerly known as Tanzu Observability by Wavefront) System events that represent the AWS events.
- **[AWS Metrics+](integrations_aws_metrics.html#aws-metrics-data)** -- retrieves additional metrics using AWS APIs other than CloudWatch. Data include EBS volume data and  EC2 instance metadata like tags. You can investigate billing data  and the number of reserved instances. Be sure to enable AWS+ metrics because it allows VMware Aria Operations for Applications to optimize its use of CloudWatch, and saves money on CloudWatch calls as a result.

{% include tip.html content="See [AWS CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and Metrics+ Integrations](integrations_aws_metrics.html)" %}

### Establish a Trust Relationship

Adding an AWS integration requires establishing a trust relationship between Amazon and VMware Aria Operations for Applications by specifying account information. You have to do that only once, and you have 2 options:

* [Give Global Read-Only Access](#give-read-only-access-to-your-amazon-account-and-get-the-role-arn)
* [Give Limited Access](#giving-limited-access)

After you've set up the integration, you can examine metrics from all AWS services that you subscribe to from the VMware Aria Operations for Applications GUI. The integration includes a predefined dashboard for each service. You can clone and modify the system dashboards, or create your own custom dashboard.

<!--### Use Internal Metrics to Monitor AWS Integrations

You can use some Tanzu Observability by Wavefront internal metrics to [monitor your AWS Integration](wavefront_monitoring.html#aws-integration).-->

### AWS Dashboards

If you set up an [Amazon Web Services integration](integrations.html), we install the AWS overview dashboards such as Summary, Pricing, and Billing and the AWS service-specific dashboards: EC2, ECS, ELB, DynamoDB, Lambda, Redshift, and so on. All AWS dashboards have a tag `~integration.aws.<service>`. For example: `~integration.aws.ec2`, `~integration.aws.lambda`, etc.

{% include shared/system_dashboard.html %}


## Giving Access to Your AWS Account

Data flows from AWS only if the account has the required access. You have several options:

<table style="width: 100%;">
<colgroup>
<col width="20%" />
<col width="80%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ReadOnlyAccess policy (most services)</td>
<td markdown="span">In most cases, it makes sense to give the `ReadOnlyAccess` policy to the Amazon account.</td></tr>

<td markdown="span">Explicitly specify the access settings in a custom IAM policy, as discussed in [Giving Limited Access](#create-iam-policy-to-specify-limited-access).</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


### Give Read-Only Access to Your Amazon Account and Get the Role ARN

To grant Operations for Applications with read-only access to your Amazon account, you need to provide an account ID and external ID. While the account ID is a constant value - the ID to which you want to grant access to your resources, the external ID is not a constant value. The external ID is a secret identifier that is known by you and VMware Aria Operations for Applications (the third-party). The external ID is time-sensitive and regenerated each time you reopen the AWS Integration setup page, and you cannot reuse it.

For information about external IDs and how they are used in AWS, see [How to Use External ID When Granting Access to Your AWS Resources](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-use-external-id-when-granting-access-to-your-aws-resources/).


1. Log in to your AWS account.
1. Search for the **IAM** (AWS Identity and Access Management) service and click it.
1. Under **Access management** on the left, click **Roles**.
1. Click **Create role**.
1. Click the **AWS account** tile, and select the **Another AWS account** radio button.
1. Enter the account information:
   - **Account ID** - The identifier of the account to which you want to grant access. 
     To get the account ID:
      1. Navigate to your service instance.
      2. Click **Integrations** on the toolbar and click the **Amazon Web Services** integration tile. 
      3. Click the **Setup** tab and click the **How to get Role ARN** link.
      4. Copy the **Account ID** displayed in the instructions.
    
   - Select the option **Require external ID** and provide the external ID. 
   
       Copy the **External ID** displayed in the instructions on the **Amazon Web Services** integration **Setup** page (in your VMware Aria Operations for Applications GUI) and paste it into the text box in the AWS UI.
     
1. Click **Next**.
1. On the **Add permissions** screen, search for, and select the **ReadOnlyAccess** check box.

   You get many results when you search for ReadOnlyAccess. Scroll down and browse through the pages until you find ReadOnlyAccess or click the **Policy name** column name to get the results sorted in reverse alphabetical order.

1. Click **Next**.
1. In the **Role name** text box, provide a unique name of the role and click **Create role**.
1. On the **Roles** page, click the newly created role.
1. Copy the **ARN** value, so that you can use it when you configure your AWS integration.


### Giving Limited Access

Instead of giving global read-only access, you can give more limited access.  

The required permissions for limited access, shown in the table below, are sufficient for monitoring your AWS services. You need to include the whole list of minimum required services and permissions as shown in the [example snippet](integrations_aws_overview.html#create-iam-policy-to-specify-limited-access). 

<table>
<thead>
<tr><th width="20%">Integration</th><th width="45%">Description</th><th width="35%">Required Permissions</th></tr>
</thead>

    <td>CloudWatch</td>
    <td>Retrieves AWS metric and dimension data. </td>
    <td>ListMetrics<br />
      GetMetric*<br />

</tr>
</table>

### Create IAM Policy to Specify Limited Access

You can explicitly specify the access permissions in a custom IAM policy, as shown in the following example snippet. 

**Note**: This snippet contains the minimum required list of services and permissions. If you delete a service and its permission from the list, some of the integration functionality might get impacted.

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "cloudwatch:GetMetric*",
                "cloudwatch:ListMetrics",
                "ec2:Describe*",
                "s3:List*",
                "s3:Get*",
                "rds:Describe*",
                "sqs:ListQueue*",
                "sqs:GetQueue*",
                "dynamodb:ListTables",
                "dynamodb:DescribeTable",
                "eks:Describe*",
                "eks:List*",
                "support:DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks",
                "support:RefreshTrustedAdvisorCheck",
                "support:DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckResult",
                "es:ListDomainNames",
                "es:DescribeElasticsearchDomain",
                "es:ListTags",
                "iam:ListAccountAliases"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Managing an AWS Integration

You can set up an AWS integration, enable and disable it, and delete it. After you set up an AWS integration, you can register more services to it. You can also [add and manage AWS integrations by using our REST API](integrations_aws_overview_API.html).

### Set up an AWS Integration

To set up an AWS integration, you must have a [Role ARN](#give-read-only-access-to-your-amazon-account-and-get-the-role-arn) handy. 

1. Log in to your service instance and click **Integrations** on the toolbar.
1. In the **Featured** section, click the **Amazon Web Services** tile.
1. Click the **Setup** tab, and click **Add Integration**.   
1. Configure the integration properties:
     - **Name** - Name to identify the integration.
     - **Role ARN** - The Role ARN from your Amazon account.
1. (Optional) If you want to skip the ingestion of support service limit metrics (also known as service quotas), that is, metrics namespace `aws.limits.*`, disable **Service Limit Metrics**. You can later enable these metrics, if necessary.
1. (Optional) If you want to configure a CloudTrail integration, click **Show Advanced Options**.
     - **Bucket Name** - Enter the S3 bucket containing CloudTrail logs. 
     
        In your AWS account, go to **CloudTrail** &gt;**Trails** to see the bucket name.
        
     - **Prefix** - A log file prefix specified when you created the CloudTrail. 
     
        The default prefix is `AWSLogs`. If you use a custom prefix, you must put it here without using a forward slash at the end of the prefix, i.e. a trailing slash.
        
     - **CloudTrail Region** - AWS Region where the CloudTrail logs reside.
     
1. Click **Register**. 

The integration is added to the Amazon Web Services Integrations list. If you want to configure allow lists and refresh rate for the CloudWatch integration, click the **CloudWatch** link in the Types column and follow the instructions in [Configuring CloudWatch Data Ingestion](integrations_aws_metrics.html#configuring-cloudwatch-data-ingestion).


### Register Additional Amazon Web Services

After you set up the AWS integration with a [Role ARN](#give-read-only-access-to-your-amazon-account-and-get-the-role-arn), you can additionally register more Amazon Web services.

1. In your service instance (`https://<your_instance>.wavefront.com`), click **Integrations** on the toolbar.
1. In the Featured section, click the **Amazon Web Services** tile.
1. Click the **Setup** tab.
1. Click the **Advanced** link.
1. In the Cloud Integration page, click **Add Amazon Web Services** and select an option:
   * To register an AWS Metrics+ service, select **Register AWS Metrics+**, and configure the following integration properties:
      
      1. **Name** -- Name to identify the integration.
      2. **Role ARN** -- Select the Role ARN from your Amazon account.
      3. **Service Limit Metrics** -- Disable or enable the ingestion of support service limit metrics (also known as service quotas), that is, metrics namespace `aws.limits.*`. 
   
   * To register a CloudTrail service, select **Register CloudTrail**, and configure the following integration properties:
      
      1. **Name** - Name to identify the integration.
      2. **Role ARN** -- Select the Role ARN from your Amazon account.
      3. **Bucket Name** -- The S3 bucket that contains CloudTrail logs. 
         
         In AWS, go to **CloudTrail** &gt;**Trails** to see the bucket name.
         
      4. **Prefix** -- A log file prefix specified when you created the CloudTrail. 
         
         The default prefix is `AWSLogs`. If you use a custom prefix, you must put it here without using a forward slash at the end of the prefix, i.e. a trailing slash.
         
      5. **Region** -- AWS Region where the CloudTrail logs reside.
       
   * To register a CloudWatch service, select **Register CloudWatch**, and configure the following integration properties:
   
      1. **Name** -- Name to identify the integration.
      2. **Role ARN** -- Select the Role ARN from your Amazon account.
      3. Allow Lists and Service Refresh Rate -- see [Configuring CloudWatch Data Ingestion](integrations_aws_metrics.html#configuring-cloudwatch-data-ingestion).
     
1.  Click **Register**. The selected integrations are created and added to the Cloud Integrations list.

### Enable and Disable AWS Integrations

We automatically disable integrations that are experiencing errors due to invalid credentials. To enable an integration after the credential has been corrected or to manually disable an integration:

1. In your service instance (`https://<your_instance>.wavefront.com`), click **Integrations** on the toolbar.
1. In the **Featured** section, click the **Amazon Web Services** tile.
1. Click the **Setup** tab.
1. Click the **Advanced** link.
1. In the row that contains the integration that you want to enable or disable, click the ellipsis icon, and select **Enable** or **Disable**.


### Delete AWS Integrations

You can delete an AWS integration if you no longer need it:

1. In your service instance (`https://<your_instance>.wavefront.com`), click **Integrations** on the toolbar.
1. In the **Featured** section, click the **Amazon Web Services** tile.
1. Click the **Setup** tab.
1. Click the **Advanced** link.
1. In the row that contains the integration that you want to delete, click the ellipsis icon, and select **Delete**.
1. Confirm the deletion.

New metrics will no longer be fetched from the AWS integration that you deleted. However, existing metrics are not affected.

## Viewing AWS Metrics

You can view AWS metrics by selecting **Browse &gt; Metrics** and searching for metrics beginning with `aws.`:

![aws metrics](images/aws_metrics.png)

You can drill into the folder for a specific service and click a metric to navigate to a chart that displays that set of data. For example, clicking the folder `aws.ec2.`, then the metric `aws.ec2.cpuutilization`, and then refining the query by the `Region` point tag and the `topk` function yields the following chart:

![aws cpu utilization](images/aws_cpu_utilization.png)

### AWS Aggregate Metrics

All AWS metrics return the following aggregate metrics: average, maximum, minimum, sample count, and sum. To view the aggregate metrics,

1.  Search for a specific metric, for example `aws.ec2.cpuutilization`:

    ![aws cpu utilization folder](images/aws_cpu_utilization_metric.png)

2.  Click the metric folder, for example `aws.ec2.cpuutilization.`, to display the aggregate metrics:

    ![aws cpu utilization aggregate metrics](images/aws_cpu_utilization_aggregate_metrics.png)
