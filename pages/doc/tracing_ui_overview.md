summary: Overview of services and applications that send data to Tanzu Observability by Wavefront.
---

As part of troubleshooting an application, you need an overview of the services and applications that send data to Tanzu Observability by Wavefront. Use our application map to understand the health of each service, and troubleshoot when your applications or services run into issues. You can see the overall health of each application using the application map, table view, and grid view.

<a name="app_map"></a>

## Application Map Features

The application map gives you an overview of how the applications and services are linked, lets you focus on a specific service, view Request, Error, and Duration (RED) metrics for each service, and the tracing traffic in the application. You can also drill down to the Service Dashboard and Tracing Browser.

This <a href="https://vmwaretv.vmware.com/media/t/1_atlrv7sa" target="_blank">video<img src="/images/video_camera.png" alt="video camera icon"/></a> highlights the application map features and settings:

<iframe id="kmsembed-1_atlrv7sa" width="608" height="402" src="https://vmwaretv.vmware.com/embed/secure/iframe/entryId/1_atlrv7sa/uiConfId/49694343/pbc/252649793/st/0" class="kmsembed" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozAllowFullScreen allow="autoplay *; fullscreen *; encrypted-media *" referrerPolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" frameborder="0" alt="application map settings"></iframe>

See the application map:
1. In your web browser, go to your Wavefront instance and log in.
1. From the toolbar, select **Applications** > **Application Status** and click the Application Map icon ( <img src="images/tracing_appmap_appmap_view_icon.png"
style="vertical-align:text-bottom;width:28px" alt="icon to click to get the application map view"/> )
1. Optionally, use <img src="images/tracing_link_icon.png"
style="vertical-align:text-bottom;width:20px" alt="icon to click to get the link"/> to get a link and share what youâ€™re seeing right now (NON-LIVE display) with other users.

Let's walk through the following scenario to get a quick overview of the application map.

      Click <b>Application/Service</b>, select <b>beachshirts</b>, and click <b>Search</b>.<br/>

      You can refine your search further by applying one or more filters, such as the cluster, shard, or span.kind.

      <br/><br/>You see the data that match your search filters and the nearest neighboring service. For example, if you filter for the beachshirts application's styling service, you only see the services that directly communicate with the styling service.

            <li>
              <b>Fade Labels on Zoom</b>: Hide labels of small services and gradually expose them as you zoom in on the application map. You always see the labels of the services in red, based on the legend settings you select.

## Table View Features

View the list of applications and services. You can see the Request, Error, and Duration (RED) metrics at a glance and sort the data.

See the table view:
1. In your web browser, go to your Wavefront instance and log in.
1. From the toolbar, select **Applications** > **Application Status** and click the Table View icon ( <img src="images/tracing_appmap_table_view_icon.png"
style="vertical-align:text-bottom;width:28px" alt="icon to click to get the table view"/> )

![the image shows the table view of all the applications that send data to Wavefront. It has helpers to show you what to do with each UI section. For example, how to filter applications or services, change the table settings or the legend settings, and how to change back to the application map view or the grid view](images/tracing_table_view.png)

Using the table view, you can:
* Examine the applications and services, or search for a particular application or service by applying filters.
  <br/>You can refine your search further by applying one or more filters, such as the cluster, shard, or span.kind.
* Click the name of the service to drill down to the Service Dashboard.
* Sort data:
  - Sort the application and service names alphabetically.
  - Sort the table in the ascending or descending order of the RED metrics.
* See the change (Î” value) in the RED metrics based on the time you selected for **Compare**.
<br/>For example, if you select **week ago** from the **Compare** drop-down, the Î” value indicate the change in RED metrics since the data was recorded a week ago.
  <br/>![shows the compare option on the table view. The drop down has the values, off (if selected doesn't show the change in value), 2 hours ago, day ago, week ago, and month ago. ](images/tracing_compare_table_view.png)
* Click the vertical ellipsis > **Create Alerts** to create smart alerts that filter noise and capture true anomalies. See [Create an alert](#create-alerts).
* Click the vertical ellipsis > **View Alerts** to view alerts that are firing for the service. The number of alerts firing for the service are shown on the **Alerts** column.
* Inspect the Apdex score and RED metrics to obtain a status summary of a service.

## Create Alerts

[Our smart alerts](alerts.html#how-alerts-work-video) capture true anomalies and filter noise. You can:

* Specify one or more alert targets that receive the alert notification(s).
* Create a multi-threshold alert to notify different targets depending on alert severity.
* View an image of the chart in the alert notification and click a link to see the alert in context.
* Examine firing alerts in Alert Viewer to get context.

Create an alert from the application status page:

1. Navigate to the app map, table view, or grid view:
    <table style = "width: 100;">
      <tr>
        <td markdown ="span">
