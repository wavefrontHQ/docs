VMware Aria Operations for Applications (formerly known as Tanzu Observability by Wavefront) continuously adds new integrations to the existing set, and improves available integrations. We update our [**complete list of all integrations**](https://docs.wavefront.com/label_integrations%20list.html) each time we add new integrations.

## January 2023

We made improvements to the following integrations in January 2023:

* Amazon Web Services -- You can now ingest and monitor AWS Lambda cold start metrics. For information about how to do this, see [Ingesting AWS Lambda Cold Start Metrics into Tanzu Observability](integrations_aws_lambda.html#ingesting-aws-lambda-cold-start-metrics-into-tanzu-observability).

* ServiceNow -- We updated the instructions on how to set up the integration to reflect the latest UI changes. See more in the [ServiceNow Setup](servicenow.html#servicenow-setup) instructions.

* Microsoft SQL Server -- Updated the charts in the **SQL Server Metrics** dashboard to use the instance variables.

* Wavefront Usage -- Made fixes to the integration and now dashboards are populated with data depending on your type of contract (Billable vs. Burndown).

* Tanzu Application Service -- Made updates to the TAS system alerts and removed some of the alerts that are no longer needed, such as:
  - TAS Active Locks Alerts
  - TAS BOSH VM CPU Used
  - TAS BOSH VM Memory Used

* Microsoft Azure -- Added vCore charts and updated variables with common queries to the **Azure SQL Database** dashboard.

General improvements:

* Metrics Charts -- All charts that you see when you select a metric on the **Metrics** tab are now improved in terms of performance and are up-to-date with the latest UI.
<!--* Clone a System Dashboard Changes -- When you [clone a system integration dashboard](integrations.html#cloning-and-customizing-dashboards), you can now add a custom metric prefix. The prefix will be applied to all the charts in the cloned dashboard.
