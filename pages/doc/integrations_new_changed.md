VMware Aria Operations for Applications (formerly known as Tanzu Observability by Wavefront) continuously adds new integrations to the existing set, and improves available integrations. We update our [**complete list of all integrations**](https://docs.wavefront.com/label_integrations%20list.html) each time we add new integrations.

## January 2024

We improved the following integration in January 2024:

* Amazon Web Services - You can now disable the ingestion of support service limit metrics (also known as service quotas), that is, the metrics with the namespace `aws.limits.*`. To do so, when you register or edit your AWS Metrics+ integration, deselect the **Service Limit Metrics** check box.
