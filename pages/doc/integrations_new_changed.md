Tanzu Observability by Wavefront continuously adds new integrations to the existing set, and improves available integrations. We update our [**complete list of all integrations**](https://docs.wavefront.com/label_integrations%20list.html) each time we add new integrations.

## October 2022

We made improvements and bug fixes to the following integrations in October 2022:

* Wavefront Usage – Made significant improvements to the **Committed Rate vs Monthly Usage (PPS P95) for Billable** and **Usage (PPS) vs Remaining Balance (PPS P95) for Burndown** dashboards. You can use the data displayed on the dashboard that suits your commit contract. For example, if you have a billable commit contract, only the **Committed Rate vs Monthly Usage (PPS P95) for Billable** dashboard will contain charts populated with data. The **Usage (PPS) vs Remaining Balance (PPS P95) for Burndown** dashboard will be empty.
* Java -- Fixed the links to the Jolokia 2 Agent documentation.
* Tanzu Application Service -- Made minor updates and fixes to the Tanzu Application Service dashboards and charts.
