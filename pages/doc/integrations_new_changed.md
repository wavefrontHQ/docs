Tanzu Observability by Wavefront continuously adds new integrations to the existing set, and improves available integrations. We update our [**complete list of all integrations**](https://docs.wavefront.com/label_integrations%20list.html) each time we add new integrations.


## June 2022

We made improvements to the following integrations in June 2022:

* Snowflake:
  * To enhance authentication security, we updated the setup steps of the integration. Now, to register Snowflake, you have to provide a private key.
  * We improved the setup instructions with information on how to generate the public and private keys and give Tanzu Observability access to your Snowflake account.
  * Improved the **Snowflake Summary** dashboard and included charts for warehouse load monitoring.

* Jenkins
  * You can now fetch metrics from Jenkins Prometheus with an authorized user instead of anonymous user.
  * We improved the setup instructions with information on how to enable a Prometheus endpoint.

* Tanzu Application Service -- Fixed issues with the **TAS: RabbitMQ** dashboard.

* vSphere -- Updated the names of a number of virtual machine charts in the  **vSphere Summary** dashboard.

## May 2022

We made improvements to the following integrations in May 2022:

* Dynatrace:
  * Improved the readability of the point tags and addressed an issue with duplicate metrics.
  * Updated the setup instructions. When you generate the API token, you should select not only **Read metrics (metrics.read)**, but also the **Read entities (entities.read)** token scope. 
  
* Fluentd -- Updated the Fluentd integration and now you can monitor Fluentd on Kubernetes.

* PostgreSQL -- Updated the setup instructions and configuration with new extensions to monitor the database.

* TAS Beta:
  * We made improvements to the TAS Beta dashboards.

## April 2022

We made improvements to the following integration in April 2022:

When you register a new CloudWatch integration or edit an existing one, you can add instances and volumes to allow lists. The format of the tag lists should be in JSON format, for example `{"organization":"yourcompany"}`.
