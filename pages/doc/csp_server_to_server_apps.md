summary: Create server-to-server apps and grant them access to VMware Aria Operations for Applications on VMware Cloud services.
---

VMware Cloud services supports server-to-server apps that can be used to automate management of Operations for Applications objects, such as dashboards, alerts, etc. A server-to-server app can't perform the **UI operations** that all user accounts can [perform by default](csp_permissions_overview.html#default-tasks).

{% include note.html content="A server-to-server app must have [permissions](csp_permissions_overview.html#operations-for-applications-permissions) to perform tasks. To run queries, a server-to-server app must have the **Metrics** permission. To manage dashboards and alerts, the server-to-server app might need both permissions and [access](csp_access.html)." %}

{% include note.html content="To manage server-to-server apps, you must be hold either the **Organization Owner** role or the **Developer** additional role. See [What organization roles are available in VMware Cloud Services](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-services/services/Using-VMware-Cloud-Services/GUID-C11D3AAC-267C-4F16-A0E3-3EDF286EBE53.html) in the VMware Cloud services documentation." %}

## What Are Server-to-Server Apps?

Server-to-server apps are used for automating management tasks.

* A server-to-server app uses **OAuth 2.0 client credentials** to authenticate. Access tokens are issued directly to the application.
* A server-to-server app can be assigned with organization roles, service roles, and custom roles.

  {% include note.html content="You must explicitly grant each server-to-server app only the permission required for the task thatâ€™s being automated (least required privilege). Doing so, you ensure that permissions for server-to-server app are always very limited." %}
* A server-to-server app can be used in multiple organizations. The owner of a server-to-server app is the organization in which it was created.

## How Server-to-Server Apps Work

If you build an application or tool that manages proxies or ingests data, then that tool must authenticate to the Operations for Applications REST API.

1. Create a server-to-server app in VMware Cloud services.
1. Assign one or more roles to the server-to-server app to grant it the [Operations for Applications permissions](csp_permissions_overview.html#operations-for-applications-permissions) it needs.
1. Obtain the OAuth 2.0 client credentials of the server-to-server app.
1. Add the app to your organization.
1. Configure your tool to pass the OAuth 2.0 client credentials to the REST API.

See [How to use OAuth 2.0 for server to server apps](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-services/services/Using-VMware-Cloud-Services/GUID-327AE12A-85DB-474B-89B2-86651DF91C77.html) in the VMware Cloud services documentation.

   The access token is directly issued to your tool and it authenticates seamlessly to the API.

After you create a server-to-server app, you can change its roles, share it with organizations, and delete it when no longer need it.
