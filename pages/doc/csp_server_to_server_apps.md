summary: Create server to server apps and grant them access to VMware Aria Operations for Applications on VMware Cloud services.

{% include note.html content="Starting July 3, 2023, VMware Aria Operations for Applications is a service on the VMware Cloud services platform. The content in this chapter is valid for VMware Cloud services subscriptions. For **original** subscriptions, see [Manage Service Accounts](service-accounts.html)."%}

VMware Cloud services supports server to server apps that you can use to automate management of Operations for Applications objects, such as dashboards, alerts, etc. A server to server app can't perform the **UI operations** that all user accounts can [perform by default](csp_permissions_overview.html#default-tasks).

{% include note.html content="A server to server app must hold roles with certain [permissions](csp_permissions_overview.html#operations-for-applications-permissions) to perform tasks. To run queries, a server to server app must hold the [**Metrics** service role](csp_users_roles.html#operations-for-applications-service-roles-built-in) or a [custom role](csp_users_roles.html#create-edit-or-delete-a-custom-role) with the **Metrics** permission. To manage dashboards and alerts, the server to server app might need both roles with permissions and [access](csp_access.html)." %}

## What Are Server to Server Apps?

Server to server apps are used for automating management tasks. 

* A server to server app uses **OAuth 2.0 client credentials** to authenticate. Access tokens are issued directly to the application.
* A server to server app can be assigned with organization roles, service roles, and custom roles.

  {% include note.html content="You must explicitly grant each server to server app only the role with the permission required for the task thatâ€™s being automated (least required privilege). Doing so, you ensure that permissions for server to server app are always very limited." %}
* A server to server app can be used in multiple organizations. The owner of a server to server app is the organization in which it was created.
* A server to server app in VMware Cloud services corresponds to a service account in Operations for Applications.

## How Server to Server Apps Work

{% include note.html content="To manage server to server apps, you must hold either the VMware Cloud **Organization Owner** role or the VMware Cloud **Developer** additional role. See [What organization roles are available in VMware Cloud Services](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-services/services/Using-VMware-Cloud-Services/GUID-C11D3AAC-267C-4F16-A0E3-3EDF286EBE53.html) in the VMware Cloud services documentation." %}

If you build an application or tool that manages proxies or ingests data, then that tool must authenticate to the Operations for Applications REST API with an access token. Here's how it works:

1. Create a server to server app in VMware Cloud services. See [How to use OAuth 2.0 for server to server apps](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-services/services/Using-VMware-Cloud-Services/GUID-327AE12A-85DB-474B-89B2-86651DF91C77.html) in the VMware Cloud services documentation.
1. Assign the server to server app with one or more [Operations for Applications service roles](csp_users_roles.html#operations-for-applications-service-roles-built-in) for the service instance.

   {% include important.html content="Ensure that you assign the server to server app **only** with the roles and permissions that are needed. Do not assign all roles listed in the VMware Cloud Services Console." %}

   For example, to use a server to server app only for setting up the Operations for Applications integrations, assign only the **Proxies** service role to the app.

   If you plan to assign the server to server app a custom role, you must assign that server to server app at least one Operations for Applications service role, for example **Viewer**.

1. Optionally, assign the server to server app a [custom role](csp_users_roles.html#create-edit-or-delete-a-custom-role) with an [Operations for Applications permission](csp_permissions_overview.html#operations-for-applications-permissions).

    {% include important.html content="In a multi-tenant Operations for Applications environment, custom roles apply to **all** service instances (tenants) to which the server to server app has access, that is, for which the server to server app has at least one service role."%}
    
1. Obtain the OAuth 2.0 client credentials of the server to server app and save them to a secure place.
1. Add the app to your VMware Cloud organization running the Operations for Applications service.
1. Configure your tool to pass the OAuth 2.0 client credentials to the REST API and exchange them to an access token. See [Make API Calls by Using a Server to Server App](using_wavefront_api.html#make-api-calls-by-using-a-server-to-server-app).

   The access token is directly issued to your tool and it authenticates seamlessly to the API.

After you create a server to server app, you can change its roles, share it with other VMware Cloud organizations, and delete it when no longer need it.
