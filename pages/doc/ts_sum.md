## Summary
```
sum(<tsExpression>[,metrics|sources|sourceTags|pointTags|<pointTagKey>])
```
Returns the sum of the set of time series described by the expression.
The results might be computed from real reported values and interpolated values.
Use [`rawsum()`](ts_rawsum.html) if you don't need interpolation.

You can group using the literals <strong>metrics</strong>, <strong>sources</strong>, <strong>sourceTags</strong>, and <strong>pointTags</strong> to group by metric names, source names, source tag names, or point tag names. </li>
<li>You can specify the name of a point tag key. For example, assume you have an <strong>env</strong> point tag with 2 possible values (<strong>prod</strong> and <strong>dev</strong>).

## Description

The `sum()` aggregation function adds together the data values at each moment in time, across the time series that are represented by the expression.

By default, `sum()` produces a single series of sums by aggregating values across all time series. You can optionally group the time series based on one or more characteristics, and obtain a separate series of sums for each group.

If any time series has data gaps, `sum()` fills them in by interpolation whenever possible.


### Grouping

Like all aggregation functions, `sum()` returns a single series of results by default. You can include a `group by` parameter to obtain separate subtotals for groups of time series that share common metric names, source names, source tags, point tags, or values for a particular point tag key.
The function returns a separate series of results corresponding to each group.

You can specify multiple 'group by' parameters to group the time series based on multiple characteristics. For example, `sum(ts("cpu.cpu*"), metrics, Customer)` first groups by metric names, and then groups by the values of the `Customer` point tag.

{% include note.html content="Starting with the 2023-20.x release, grouping is case-sensitive. For example, if you ingest point tags such as `zone` and `ZONE`, when you use an aggregation function and apply grouping, we consider `zone` and `ZONE` as separate tags. " %}

### Interpolation

If any time series has gaps in its data, the query engine attempts to fill these gaps with interpolated values before applying the function.
A value can be interpolated into a time series only if at least one other time series reports a real data value at the same moment in time.

Within a given time series, an interpolated value is calculated from two real reported values on either side of it.
Sometimes interpolation is not possible--for example, when a new value has not been reported yet in a live-view chart.
In this case, the query engine finds the last known reported value in the series, and assigns it to any subsequent moment in time for which a real reported data value is present in some other time series. We use the last known reported value only if interpolation canâ€™t occur _and_ if the last known reported value has been reported within the last 15% of the query time in the chart window.

You can use [`rawsum()`](ts_rawsum.html) to suppress interpolation.  See [Standard Versus Raw Aggregation Functions](query_language_aggregate_functions.html).


## Examples

The following set of examples uses the metrics returned by `ts(~sample.cpu.loadavg.1m)`. Each time series that's returned reports CPU load averages from a particular source associated with particular point tag values.
The following examples sum these series in different ways.

**Example 1: Use Sum with No Filtering, Noo Grouping**

Here we include all of the time series in the results:

```sum(ts(~sample.cpu.loadavg.1m))```

Summing these series adds their values "vertically" to produce a single series of sums, so the chart shows a single line. For example, the aggregated value at around 2pm is the sum of the individual values reported by each time series at that time.

**Example 2: Filtering by Source**

Here we filter the time series to include only those reported from `db-*` servers in the results. We still see a single line, but a different pattern. Notice that the aggregated value at changes because it's the sum of values from fewer series.

`sum(ts(~sample.cpu.loadavg.1m AND source="db-*"))`

**Example 3: Grouping by Point Tag**

Here we not only filter by source, but we also group the results to obtain separate subtotals for each `env` point tag value. This chart displays one line that sums the series with `env=production`, and a second line that sums the series with `env=dev`. This chart allows you to compare the CPU load patterns across the two groups of servers.

`sum(ts(~sample.cpu.loadavg.1m AND source="db-*") ,env)`

## Caveats

Using `rawsum()` instead of `sum()` can significantly improve query performance because `rawsum()` does not perform interpolation.
