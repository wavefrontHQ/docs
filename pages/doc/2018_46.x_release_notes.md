## AI Genie Anomaly Detection and Forecasting

This release includes the new [AI Genie UI](ai_genie.html) for anomaly detection and forecasting.
* Access AI Genie from any chart using the **Open AI Genie** button.

* Select **Anomaly Detection** to highlight anomalous behavior. This tab wraps the [`anomalous()` function](ts_anomalous.html) around your query.
* Select **Forecasting** to view a forecast for your current query. You can set a time window and confidence bands.

## Enhancements to Wavefront Authorization

We've made multiple enhancements to [Wavefront authorization](authorization.html):
* [Groups](users_groups.html) make it easy to quickly make changes such as assigning permissions to many users at once.
* Permission names that are visible in the UI are now more consistent and intuitive.
* To assign permissions to new users, you can:
  - Explicitly set [default new user permissions](users_groups.html#setting-default-permissions-for-new-users), as before.
  - Specify a [default group for new users](users_groups.html#setting-the-default-group-for-new-users) and set the permissions for that group (recommended).
* **Browse Data** no longer exists as an explicit permission. [The tasks that a new user can perform](users_groups.html#what-can-a-new-user-do) did not change.
* The [Wavefront REST API](wavefront_api.html) includes a new `UserGroup` object.

## New Object-Based Access Control

Wavefront has always supported global permissions, but some customers have asked for access control for individual objects, and we're making it available for dashboards in this release.
* During roll-out, we create an Everyone group that includes all current and future users. That group is added to the View & Modify access list of all dashboards, which means that all users with the **Dashboard**  permission can continue to manage all dashboards.
* Users with Dashboard permission can change access:
  - From the Dashboard browser for one or more dashboards.
  - Using the Share icon on individual dashboards
* In high security environments, users with `Users & Groups` permission can turn on a security preference. After that, only the dashboard creator and any Super Admin user can:
  - View and modify new dashboards, that is, dashboards created after the change to the preference.
  - Give other users View or View & Modify access to individual new dashboards.
  Users with View & Modify access can then also invite other users to view or view and modify the dashboard.
* Users who are [Super Admin](users_groups.html#who-is-super-admin) can share dashboards created while the Security preference was in place. Initially, one user is Super Admin on each cluster. That user can make additiona users Super Admin and can restore orphan dashboards.

## New Default Permissions for New Customers

If you became a Wavefront customer after this release went out, users in your environment will have a more comprehensive set of default permissions.

New users are encouraged to fine-tune what new users can do by [modifying the permissions](permissions.html#granting-and-revoking-permissions-for-groups) for the Everyone group or by creating User Groups with permission sets.
