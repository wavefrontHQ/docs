Tanzu Observability by Wavefront provides charts viewing and examining your data. You can <a href="ui_examine_data.html">interact directly with charts in real time</a> -- zoom in, zoom out, change the time window, and so on.

Users with dashboard permission can customize many aspects of the chart and save their changes. This page is a detailed reference to the tabs in the different chart types. We repeat tab reference for each chart type.

{% include note.html content="While every user can view charts and make temporary changes, you must have [Dashboard permission](permissions_overview.html) to save changes you make to charts." %}

{% include important.html content="This chart reference has all information for charts that are in a dashboard. Many, but <strong>not all</strong> of the same options are available for charts in alerts." %}


## Data Tab (All Charts)

For each chart (with the exception of a Markdown chart) you specify one or more queries.

When you click **Data**, you can:
* View queries for the chart and add lines.
* Use [Chart Builder](chart_builder.html) or [Query Editor](query_editor.html).
* Clone, delete, or hide one or more lines.
* Create an alert based on a chart.


## Line Plot Chart

![line plot](images/line_plot_v2.png)

Line plots are well suited both for single time series and multiple time series. You can customize many aspects of your line plots.

A **line plot** represents interpolated point buckets. The X axis represents the amount of time in your time window and the Y axis represents the value associated with the data based on that time.

Missing data is represented by a dashed line. The dashed line only gives a visual representation of the data stream; it _does not_ represent values of the missing data. If you hover over the chart, you won't see values where the gap threshold has been applied. Use the **Format > Gap Threshold** property to set the amount of time before gaps of missing data display as dashed lines.

## Point Plot Chart

![point plot](images/point_plot_v2.png)

A **point plot** chart displays point buckets *without* any interpolation. Like a line chart, the X-axis represents the amount of time in your time window, and the Y-axis represents the value associated with the data during that time window.

## Stacked Area Chart

![stacked area](images/stacked_area_v2.png)

A **stacked area** chart is similar to a line chart, but each line is filled in as a solid block with blocks stacked on top of each other.

The stacked area chart can help you determine at a glance which queries have the largest magnitude at any point in time. It is most commonly used to visually compare two or more quantities.

<li><strong>Center the Stream</strong> - Represents the collective magnitude of the queries displayed on the chart with the band narrowing or widening as the metrics fluctuate over time.</li>

##  Markdown Chart

A **Markdown** chart allows you to provide in-depth text descriptions of a dashboard and individual charts using Markdown. We support [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/)

In addition to Markdown formatted text, you can use links, images hosted at a location of your choice, and [dashboard variables](dashboards_variables.html). You can refer to the value of a dashboard variable with the query variable syntax **${var_name}** and the label of the variable using **%{var_name}**. Using a label instead of the variable value could be useful for list variables that might show the dropdown labels such as: Any, 1 Year, 3 Years which could map to opaque values such as -1, 1, 3.

You can pass a time window as a parameter in markdown. For example, when you create a dynamic link in a markdown chart, from the time selector you can pick a specific time window. When you click the link on the markdown chart, you will see the chart within the current time range that you’ve selected.

When you add a markdown chart with a dashboard dynamic link to an existing dashboard, for example, `[[dashboardURLWithCurrentTimeRange url=/tracing/service/details title=MyChart]]`, clicking the link on the markdown chart, will open a dashboard within the time range that is specified in the parent dashboard, i.e. the dashboard to which you've added the markdown chart.

## Single Stat Chart

![single stat](images/single_stat_v2.png)

By default, a **single stat** chart plots a single series on a chart and displays a summarized value for that series in large font on the chart. The font size and placement of the displayed value can be unique for each chart. A common use case is displaying instantaneous values of critical metrics on an overhead display.

## Node Map Chart

![node map chart](images/node_map.png)

A **node map** chart shows colored 3-D cubes ordered from highest to lowest. Node maps show data based on source values.
* By default, the node map displays the highest value on the top left to catch the user's eye.
* When a user clicks a node, a small popup of the corresponding metric for that source results. You might have to modify the query to ensure that the query returns a source. In some cases, it's necessary to use `aliasSource()` to get the desired results.
* Use [color mapping](ui_charts_faq.html#how-do-i-set-up-color-mapping) to determine colors for higher values. The node map uses shading to show transitions. In the example above, values below 0.3 are shown as green, values lower than 0.8 are shown as a shade of yellow.
* Set the group and the metric to display in the top right or in the **Node Map Defaults** tab in the chart editor. When a group is selected, only the top 12 results are displayed.
* Specify a drilldown link to direct users to a different dashboard if they click on the dashboard.

When you refresh a node map page, a short animation folds out the chart content.

<a id="node_map_format_tab">
<p><span style="font-size: large; font-weight: 600">Color Mapping Tab</span></p>

The color mapping tab lets you define which set of values maps to which colors. In the example above, values less than 0.3 are green, values less than 0.8 are yellow. All other values are red. See [How Do I Set Up Color Mapping](ui_charts_faq.html#how-do-i-set-up-color-mapping) for details.

## Histogram Chart

![histogram](images/histogram_chart_v2.png)

Histogram charts have two main uses:
* Visualize actual [histograms](proxies_histograms.html). Wavefront histograms let you compute, store, and use distributions of metrics rather than single metrics. Histograms are useful for high-velocity metrics about your applications and infrastructure – particularly those gathered across many distributed sources.
* Display a histogram visualization of a time series. That makes it possible, for example, to easily see query results above a certain percentile.

You can zoom in to the histogram as needed by selecting a region.

The histogram chart shows the aggregate view of the entire window. For both histogram data and time series data, you can visualize the amount of data in a certain percentile, specify color gradient and axis information, and, most importantly, get details about your histogram data by looking at hover text on each bar.

From the chart's edit menu, you can go to the corresponding trace (if any).

![Go to Traces menu](images/histogram_goto_menu.png)

<p><span style="font-size: large; font-weight: 600">Data Tab</span></p>

In contrast to other chart types, you must use the query editor to enter histogram information.

One easy way to show a histogram is from the **Histogram** browser.

1. Select **Browse > Histograms**
2. Drill down to the metric you're interested in and double-click it to open it in a chart.

You must make sure you're looking at a metric -- it doesn't make sense to select a folder.

## Heat Map Chart

![heat map](images/heat_map.png)

Heat map charts add another dimension to the information about histograms that you see in a histogram chart.
* The X axis shows time (same as a line plot)
* The Y axis shows distribution values (just like the X axis in histogram charts). This is what you're recording, for example, latency.
* The color saturation shows the amount of data for the selected time frame.

<p><span style="font-size: large; font-weight: 600">Data Tab</span></p>

In most cases, it makes sense to do an `hs()` query in the Query Editor.

One easy way to show which histograms are on your cluster is from the **Histogram** browser.

1. Select **Browse > Histograms**
2. Drill down to the metric you're interested in and double-click it to open it in a chart. You must make sure you're looking at a metric -- it doesn't make sense to select a folder.

## Gauge Chart

![gauge](images/gauge.png)

A gauge chart displays a single value, in a default color. You can optionally add color mapping. If you do, the  which displays in an outer ring. By default, color mapping uses 0-100, but you can define a minimum and maximum.

## Pie and Donut Chart

![pie](images/pie_chart.png)

A pie chart shows the relative size of your data as pie slices. You can show either a pie chart or a donut chart. You can customize the width of the donut ring (by percentage) and, the percentile shown for the number, and more.

The collage above shows both a pie chart and a donut chart for the same data.
