You use `events()` queries to [customize how events display in charts](charts_events_displaying.html). An `events()` query cannot be the only query on the chart. At least one `ts()` query must also be enabled on the chart.

## Event Query Syntax

An `events()` query has the following syntax:

`[<event_function>(]events([<filterName>=""<filterValue>")][and|or|not <filterName>="<filterValue>"])[)]`

where
* `<event_function>` is one of the supported [events functions](query_language_reference.html#event-functions). Events functions let you fine tune your `events()` query.
* `<filterName>` is an [event filter](#filters). You can specify multiple event filters separated by the boolean operators (and, or, not).

The following examples use only filters, see [Advanced events() Queries](events_queries_advanced.html) for examples for using events functions.

To display user events or events based on any alerts that start with `Request` and are either severity `severe` or `warn`, run one of the following queries:
- `events(name="Request\*" and (severity="severe" or severity="warn")`
- `events(name="Request\*", severity="warn" or severity="severe")`

To display events that either have severity `warn` or that are generated by the source `app-1`, run the following query:
- `events(severity="warn" or source="app-1")`

<a name="filters"></a>

## Event Filters

Event filters allow you to limit which events are returned from events() queries.

<table style="width: 100%;">

<col width="33%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr><th>Filter</th><th>Description</th><th>Example</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>alertId</td>
<td>The ID of the alert that created the event.</td>
<td><code>events(alertId=1411189741192)</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>alertTag</td>
<td>A tag associated with the alert that generated the event.</td>
<td><code>events(alertTag="ops")</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>eventTag</td>
<td>A tag associated with the event.</td>
<td><code>events(eventTag="codepushes")</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>name</td>
<td>The name of the event. Manually created events have a unique name, while events generated by an alert have the
same name as the associated alert. The name filter requires quotes if spaces exist in the name.</td>
<td><code>events(name="Request Latency too high")</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>severity</td>
<td markdown="span">The classification of the user event or the severity of alert that generated the event. User event classification levels are severe, warn, info, and unclassified.
Although an event can be left as unclassified, the severity filter does not accept the string "unclassified" as a valid value.
</td>
<td><code>events(severity="info")</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>source or tag</td>
<td>The source or source tag associated with the alert that generated the event.
The source filter allows you to display events generated by an alert based on a single source or set of sources.
The tag filter works the same way, but allows you to specify a source tag instead of a source name.</td>
<td><code>events(source="app-*" or tag="dc2")</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td id="subtype">subtype</td>
<td>
The subtype of event of type alert-detail: failing, recovered.
</td>
<td><code>events(subtype="failing")</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>target
</td>
<td markdown="span">The target of the alert that generated the event. The list of targets associated with an alert are considered a single string.
  If you want to identify a single target within that string, then you must use wildcards. For example, if the notification field contains:

  <code>john.doe@example.com, jane.doe@example.com, pd:fbw21c9ee0219473w2179r4t23f8c34,</code> to use <code>jane.doe@example.com</code> as the target filter, specify the email as <code>\*jane.doe@example.com\*</code>.</td>
<td><code>events(target="*jane.doe@example.com*")</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td id="type">type</td>
<td>The type of an event. The sytem-generated event types are:
<ul>
<li>alert</li>
<li>maintenanceWindow</li>
<li>alert-detail</li>
<li>credentials-error</li>
<li>alert-created</li>
<li>alert-updated</li>
<li>alert-deleted</li>
<li>dashboard-deleted</li>
<li>maintenancewindow-created</li>
<li>maintenancewindow-updated</li>
<li>maintenancewindow-deleted</li>
</ul>
You can optionally assign a type to a user event. The value requires quotes if it contains spaces or starts with a wildcard.
</td>
<td><code>events(type="Code push")</code><br/><code>events(type="*-created")</code></td>

## When Does an Event Query Return Events?

Where an event happens in relation to the query start time  and query end time determines whether a query returns an event or not. Returning an event means showing the event in the UI, or, if you use the API, returning the event itself. The following illustration illustrates the behavior:

![when events return](images/events_returns_22.svg)

Here are some details. Note that for two cases, the behavior changed in Wavefront 2018.10; however, the following table shows general behavior and does not focus on this (fairly minor) change.

|**Event Number** | **Event start** | **Event end** | **Returned?** |
|Event 1 | Before query start time time | Before query start time | No |
|Event 2 | After query start time | Before query end time  | Yes  |
|Event 3 | Before query start time | After query start time  | Yes  |
|Event 4 | Before query start time  | After query end time | No(*) |
|Event 5 | Before query start time | N.A. (ongoing event) | No(*) |
|Event 6 | After query start time  | After query end time | Yes  |
|Event 7 | After query end time | N.A. (ongoing event) | No  |
|Event 8 | After query start time | N.A. (ongoing event)  | Yes  |
|Event 9 | After query end time | After query end time  | No |

(*) Wavefront returned the event before 2018.10, but we no longer return it. Performance improvements are significant.

## More Info

You can use `events()` functions to fine-tune your events query.
* For examples, see [Advanced events() Queries](events_queries_advanced.html)
* For a general reference, see [Event Functions](query_language_reference.html#event-functions).
