### What Are User & Service Accounts?

VMware Aria Operations for Applications (formerly known as Tanzu Observability by Wavefront) supports two account types:
* [**User accounts**](user-accounts.html) are for human users who work with Operations for Applications. A user account authenticates with a user name and password.
* [**Service accounts**](service-accounts.html) are for services that interact with Operations for Applications through an API and use a **token** to authenticate. Service accounts are used to automate management tasks. As a user with the **Accounts** permission, you generate (and revoke, if needed) authentication tokens for the service account. Itâ€™s also possible to deactivate a service account completely. 
 Service accounts:
  - Don't have **default permissions** (unless one or more roles with permissions are assigned to the **Service Accounts** group.).
  - Can't perform the **UI operations** that user accounts can perform by default.
  In the UI, service account names always start with **sa:**.

### Who Is the Super Admin User?

When your company signs up with Operations for Applications, we ask you which users you want as Super Admin users for your service instance.

When a Super Admin user [enables Super Admin mode](users_account_managing.html#enable-or-disable-super-admin-mode), that user:

* Has all permissions.
* Has access to all dashboards and alerts.
* Can [restore orphan dashboards and alerts](access.html#make-orphan-dashboards-or-alerts-visible).
* Can invite other Super Admin users.
* Can [sign out a user](user-accounts.html#sign-out-a-user).
* Can purchase more PPS.

To invite other Super Admin users:

1. Click the gear icon <i class="fa fa-cog"/> on the toolbar, and select **Super Admin**.
2. Enter the user name of a user you want to add as a Super Admin.


### Why Roles?

Roles allow you to combine a set of permissions. For example, create an **Intern** role to give limited permissions to interns. You can:
* Assign one or more roles to any group (preferred).
* Assign a role to an individual account.

### Why Groups?

Groups allow you to combine a set of users. You can then:
* Assign a role to the group.
* Give [view or modify access](access.html) for individual dashboards and alerts to the group.

The groups in your Operations for Applications environment do *not* currently synchronize with the groups in your identity provider (IdP) such as Active Directory or LDAP.


### What's the Everyone Group?

All user accounts are members of the **Everyone** group. By default, no service account is added to this group. All service accounts are added to the **Service Accounts** group.

Here's what you need to know:

* You cannot remove accounts from the **Everyone** group. All user accounts, including Super Admin, are always in the **Everyone** group.
* You cannot delete the **Everyone** group.
* You can change the roles assigned to the **Everyone** group. By default, the group has associated roles, which means that human users can browse data but cannot modify anything. 

  **Warning** If you assign a role to the **Everyone** group, you change the permissions for each user account in your environment.
* If you use access control in your environment, you can share a dashboard or alert with the **Everyone** group to:
  - Give View & Modify access to accounts who have **Dashboards** or **Alerts** permissions.
  - Give View access to accounts who don't have **Dashboards** or **Alerts** permissions.
  You can remove the **Everyone** group from a dashboard or alert access list to limit access to that object.
  
  
### What's the Service Accounts Group?

With the 2021-42.x release, all service accounts are moved out of the **Everyone** group to the **Service Accounts** group. This separation is necessary so that you have different groups for the different types of accounts in your system. 

The **Service Accounts** group has associated roles and by default service accounts cannot browse data. If you assign a role to the **Service Accounts** group, you change the permissions for each service account in your environment.
