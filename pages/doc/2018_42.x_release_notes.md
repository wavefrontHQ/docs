### New Dashboard Features

* Status list chart can help you discover problems quickly.
* Improved dialogs facilitate presetting date and time.

## New  Internal Metric for Monitoring Ongoing Events

A new [internal metric](wavefront_monitoring.html#wavefront-internal-metrics-overview), `~events.num-ongoing-events`, returns the number of ongoing events. Wavefront limits the number of ongoing events to 1000 to avoid performance degradation in your cluster.

## Azure Insights Metrics Name Change

All metrics we previously reported as `azure.microsoft.insights.*` are now reported as `azure.insights.*`. This metric name maps better to the actual metric.

## Histogram Browser

Users who have licensed histograms can now select **Browse > Histograms** to [view histogram metrics](proxies_histograms.html#viewing-histogram-metrics). In charts, display the median by default. We display metrics for minute (m), hour (h), or day (d) separately.
