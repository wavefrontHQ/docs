These release notes give an overview of the changes for Release 2020.14 of the VMware Aria Operations for Applications (previously known as Tanzu Observability by Wavefront) service.

## Wavefront for Spring Boot
[Wavefront for Spring Boot](wavefront_springboot.html) allows you to quickly configure your environment, so Spring Boot components send metrics, histograms, and traces/spans to the Wavefront service. After youâ€™ve completed setup, you can examine the data in preconfigured or custom Wavefront dashboards.
* Try out the [tutorial](wavefront_springboot_tutorial.html) and see how you can send your data to Wavefront in a few simple steps.
* To start from scratch, see [Wavefront for Spring Boot on GitHub](https://github.com/wavefrontHQ/wavefront-spring-boot).

{% include note.html content="Wavefront for Spring Boot is not dependent on the Wavefront service that your cluster is running. " %}

## Dashboard Wizard and Chart Builder Support Histogram Option

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="60%" markdown="span">The dashboard wizard allows you to [create a dashboard](ui_dashboards.html#create-a-dashboard) with one or more charts from data, charts, or integration templates. Going forward, if you select **Data**, you're prompted to select metrics or histogram data.
</td>
<td width="40%"><img src="/images/create_dashboard_from_histogram.png" alt="Create dashboard from histogram"/>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="60%" markdown="span">Chart builder allows you to select metrics or histogram distributions.
</td>
<td width="40%"><img src="images/chart_builder_histograms.png" alt="Histogram option in chart builder"/>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Histogram Heat Map Chart

This release supports a [histogram heat map chart](visualize_histograms.html#visualize-histogram-distributions-in-a-heat-map).

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="40%">
<ul>
  <li> Visualize histograms in three dimensions (time, distribution, and color saturation). <br/>Color saturation shows density, that is how many values are in this field.</li>
  <li> Select any field to show a hover legend that displays the full histogram, and it also highlights the field that is currently selected.</li>
</ul>
</td>
<td width="60%"><img src="images/heat_map.png" alt="histogram heat map">
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Application Map (Beta)

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="40%" markdown="span">Get an overview of how the applications and services are linked, focus on a specific service, and view Request, Error, and Duration (RED) metrics for each service and the edges in the application using the new [application map](tracing_ui_overview.html#application-map-features). That's not all, you can view traces for the services and edges and drill down from the application map.
</td>
<td width="60%"><img src="images/tracing_application_map_release_notes.png" alt="application map">
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Gauge Chart


<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="80%" markdown="span"><br>
This release supports <a href="ui_chart_reference.html#gauge-chart">gauge charts</a>, which are similar to single stat charts but allow you to show the possible values in an outer ring and customize coloring for that outer ring.
</td>
<td width="20%"><img src="images/gauge_chart_color_simple.png" alt="gauge chart">
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Other Changes

We made several other improvements, some of them in response to customer requests:

### Dynamic Variables Support Wildcard Character

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="40%" markdown="span">The values of a [dynamic dashboard variable](dashboards_variables.html#dynamic-dashboard-variables) are determined by a query based on the state of the system at the time the query is executed. For example, that makes it possible for users to select all point tag values or specific point tag values from a dashboard that uses the variable. This release supports wildcards for all dynamic variable options (source, point tag, etc.).
</td>
<td width="60%"><img src="/images/select_point_tag_variable.png" alt="Select point tag variable"/>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>



### Change in AWS Integration

The AWS integration now uses the newer CloudWatch `GetMetricData` API to collect metrics.

{% include note.html content="If you've given Wavefront Read Only access, no action is required. If you've given Wavefront limited access, change the permissions [following this example](integrations_aws_overview.html#create-iam-policy-to-specify-limited-access)." %}

### Proxy 7.0

We recently release Wavefront Proxy 7.0, which includes a significant number of new features. See [Wavefront Proxy Release Notes](proxies_versions.html).

<!---
This change moved to the next release

### Additions to ~query.*.scanned Internal Metrics

New internal metrics allow you to monitor histograms and spans. The result is the following:

<table style="width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="30%">~query.summaries_scanned</td>
<td width="70%">Per-second rate at which metrics are being queried from dashboards, alerts, charts or API calls.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="30%">~query.spans_scanned</td>
<td width="70%">Per-second rate at which spans are being queried from dashboards, alerts, charts or API calls.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="30%">~query.histograms_scanned</td>
<td width="70%">Per-second rate at which histograms are being queried from dashboards, alerts, charts or API calls.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
