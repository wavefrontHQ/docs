summary: Learn how you can monitor your application using eBPF or tracing from your applications running on a Kubernetes cluster.
---

We can help you auto-discover and monitor your applications that run on a Kubernetes cluster or monitor your applications and services through the traces and spans sent to our service. 

You need to select how you want to send data to our service based on where the application runs or how you have configured your application. 

## Monitor Applications Running on Kubernetes

Send eBPF data from your applications running on a Kubernetes cluster. We can then auto-discover all the services in your Kubernetes cluster

### Send Data

Go to Kubernetes App Auto-Instrumentation via Pixie, and follow the instructions to send data and start monitoring your application


### Visualize Your Data

You can use the different dashboard and 

* View the services on the Service Map. 
* Identify potential hotspots using the Service Dashboard. 
* Create charts using the RED metrics.
