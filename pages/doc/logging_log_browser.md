Did you notice anomalies on your metrics charts or noticed that a service on the application map has large latency value? Use the Log Browser to search and filter logs, and troubleshoot your issues.

## Get Started with the Log Browser

To use the Log Browser:

1. Configure your application and the log shipper to [send logs to Tanzu Observability](logging_send_logs.html).
1. In your web browser, go to your Wavefront instance and log in.
1. From the toolbar, select **Logs**. You are taken to the Log Browser.

{%include note.html content="Tanzu Observability retains logs for 7, 15, or 30 days, based on your settings."%}

## Enable or Disable Auto-Search

Auto search is a user-level setting, and you can enable or disable auto search.

* When auto-search is disabled, you need to click **Search** to get the search results.
* When auto-search is enabled, the search runs each time you add a source, tag, or text to the search bar.

## Search and Filter Logs

Follow these steps to search and filter logs:

1. Click the date picker to select a time window you want to see logs. A default time window is set for you based on your settings.
1. To get the list of logs you want, you have these options:
  * Click **Source** and select a [source](logging_overview.html#whats-a-tanzu-observability-log) from the list.
  * Click on a tag and select a value from the list.
  * Type in a word(s) on the search bar, and click **Search** or press Enter when [using the Keyboard to navigate](wavefront_keyboard_shortcuts.html#keyboard-shortcuts-and-their-usage).
    <br/>Example:
    ![Shows the error word on the search bad and the logs that contain the word error in them with error highlighted on the log messages](images/logging_search_key_word.png)
1. When you see the logs on the Log Browser, you can filter logs using source, tags, and words, to refine the search results further.
    

## Enable or Disable Scroll Auto-Load

When you search and filter logs, you can decide how you want to scroll through the results:
* When you scroll through the results, you need to click **Load More Results** to load the next set of results.
  ![a screenshot shoing the load more results text](images/logging_load_more_results.png)
* Enable scroll auto load to load the logs as you scroll through the results. Follow these steps to enable scroll auto-load.
  1. Click **Options** on the top-right corner of the log results table.
  1. Select **Scroll Auto-Load**.

## Exclude or Include Logs from Search Results

You streamline what you see in the Log Browser by excluding tags, text, or a source.

* Click the equal (=) or not equal sign (â‰ ) next to a **Source** or tag value.
* Click on a filter on the search bar and click the filter or exclude option.
* Double click a word, or select words on the **Message** column, and click **Exclude** or **Include**.

Example: Click the application filter on the search bar, and click **Exclude application: wavefront**.

## Use The Histogram to Drill Down

At the top of the Log Browser is a histogram that shows the number of logs distributed throughout a time window. The histogram chart is broken into 60 buckets. Therefore, if you have the default 15-minute time window, the bars on the chart show the number of logs for 15-second time intervals.

If you notice a spike in the data, you can zoom in on the chart to analyze the data. When you zoom in, the table with the log data updates so it only has the data for the new time window.

Let's look at an example:

1. In the screenshot below, there are three spikes on the histogram chart.
    ![a screenshot of the Log Browser that shows a histogram with 3 spikes.](images/logging_histogram_spikes.png)
1. If you want to zoom in to the time window of the last spike, place your cursor at the beginning of the time window you want, and click and drag.
    ![a screenshot of selecting the area on the histogram to to zoom in.](images/logging_histogram_zoomed_in.png)

1. Now, you see the data for the zoomed-in time window. The logs in the log table below are updated to fit the new time window.
    ![a screenshot of the zoomed in histogram](images/logging_histogram_zoomed_in_data.png)
1. Click the button with the (-) icon or the predefined time windows to zoom out of the histogram.
    ![a screenshot with the zoom out options highlighted with a red box](images/logging_histogram_zoom_out.png)

## Customize the Log Data Table

You see the log details in the table below the histogram chart. The data on the table is color-coordinated, so you can spot logs that need attention at a glance.

<table style="width: 100%;">
  <tr>
    <th width="20%">
      Color
    </th>
    <th width="80%">
      Description
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Yellow
    </td>
    <td>
      Logs that have the term warn or warning.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Red
    </td>
    <td>
      Logs that have the term error.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Purple
    </td>
    <td>
      Logs that have the term fatal error.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Blue
    </td>
    <td>
      Logs that have the term debug.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
      Grey
    </td>
    <td>
      Logs that don't have any of the above terms.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Example:

The logs data table has the Timestamp, Source, and Message columns by default. Follow these steps to add other columns with additional data from your logs.

1. Click the add columns icon on the table.
    ![a screenshot of the table with the add column button highlighted](images/logging_log_table_add_column.png)
1. Select the columns that you want to add. The column options you see are the tags you defined when sending the data to Tanzu Observability.
    <br/> Example: Add the **tag** column.
